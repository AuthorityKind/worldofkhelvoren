          <p>
            When you’re within 5 feet of an ally on your turn, you can expend
            one superiority die and switch places with that ally, provided you
            spend at least 5 feet of movement. This movement doesn’t provoke
            opportunity attacks. Roll the superiority die. Until the start of
            your next turn, the ally gains a bonus to AC equal to the number
            rolled.

          <p>
            When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of
            your attacks and use a bonus action to direct one of your companions
            to strike. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or
            hear you and expend one superiority die. That creature can
            immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack, adding the
            superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

          <p>
            On your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one superiority
            die to bolster the resolve of one of your companions. When you do
            so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That
            creature gains temporary hit points equal to the superiority die
            roll + your Charisma modifier.

            As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend a superiority die and
            throw sand or dirt at a creature within 5 feet and force them to
            make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature
            takes damage equal to your superiority die roll and is blinded until
            the start of your next turn.

          <p>
            You can expend one superiority die and use a bonus action on your
            turn to feint, choosing one creature within 5 feet of you as your
            target. You have advantage on your next attack roll against that
            creature before the end of your turn. If that attack hits, add the
            superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

            your turn, you can expend one superiority die and use a bonus action
            to grapple the target. Add the superiority die to your Athletics

            the second creature, it takes damage equal to the number you roll on
