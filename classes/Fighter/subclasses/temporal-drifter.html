    <!--Lesser Precognition-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2>Lesser Precognition</h2>
      <p>
        When you choose this archetype, you then gain the ability to, for a very
        brief instant, see the moments to come. You can expend 1 Superiority
        Dice and use your reaction to see 6 seconds into the future. The DM
        describes what the most likely scenario is. Your character does have
        agency in this vision, so can choose to interact with the environment,
        like opening a door or saying something to someone. Once the vision
        ends, you return to the present with the knowledge of that vision.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!--Temporal Insight-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2>Temporal Insight</h2>
      <p>
        Additionally at 3rd level. You get a greater instinctive gut feeling of
        what's to come. You add your Intelligence modifier to your initiative.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!--Borrowed Time-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2>Borrowed Time</h2>
      <p>
        At 7th level, you can pocket your own time to then use it later, slowing
        you down now but speeding you up later. You can expend 1 Superiority
        Dice to use an action to get an additional action on your next turn. You
        can only do this once per turn.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!--Chronosurge-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2>Chronosurge</h2>
      <p>
        Also at 7th You can speed up time for yourself for a brief moment. When
        you use your Action Surge feature, all of your speeds are increased
        equal to a number of feet equal to 10 times your Intelligence modifier
        until the end of your turn.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!--Redo-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2>Redo</h2>
      <p>
        At 10th level, you can spin back time for yourself to give yourself a
        second chance. As a reaction, you can expend 2 Superiority Dice to give
        back all expended actions, bonus actions, and features, and you regain
        all of your spend movement that you have spent this turn. All of the
        effects of your previously taken actions, bonus actions, or features
        become reverted and nullified and you get placed back where you started.
        You keep any knowledge you acquired and all experiences you had.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!--Timely Intuition-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2>Timely Intuition</h2>
      <p>
        Additionally, at 10th level, you have acquired a deeper source of time
        manipulation and foresight. You gain a pool of Temporal Points equal to
        your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). These Temporal Points can be
        spent in place of Superiority Dice for Temporal Drifter Features. You
        regain all expended Temporal Points after a long rest.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!--Greater Precognition-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2>Greater Precognition</h2>
      <p>
        At 15th level, you can see further into the future than you could
        before. As an action, you see 1 minute into the future. This ability
        functions identically to Lesser Precognition except for the duration of
        the vision. Once you do this, you need to take a long rest to do it
        again or expend 2 Superiority Dice.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!--Recall-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2>Recall</h2>
      <p>
        Also at 15th level, you learn to make you jump back in time while the
        world stays put. As a bonus action, you can expend 2 Superiority Dice to
        teleport back where you were 6 seconds ago, or where you started your
        last turn if your are in combat. You can choose to expend additional
        dice beyond the cost of this ability. For each 2 extra Superiority Dice
        you expend above the normal cost, you jump an additional 6 seconds back
        in time, or go back another turn to where you started on that turn you
        went back to if you are in combat.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!--Timely Intuition-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2>Timely Intuition</h2>
      <p>
        At 18th level, you can let the flow of time go through you, allowing you
        unprecedented foresight. As a bonus action, you enter your Temporal
        Exploitation, which lasts a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence
        Modifier. While in your Temporal Exploitation, you gain the following
        benefits:
      </p>
      <p id="indent">
        &bull; You gain advantage on all weapon attack rolls and saving throws.
        You can choose to reroll the lowest of the 2 dice, made as part of a
        weapon attack roll or saving throw, once per Temporal Exploitation.
      </p>
      <p id="indent">
        &bull; Creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attacks against you.
        You can choose to make them reroll the highest of the 2 dice, made as
        part of the opportunity attack roll, once per Temporal Exploitation.
      </p>
      <p id="indent">
        &bull; You get a +3 bonus to your AC.
