    <!--Psionic Power-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2 class="feature">Psionic Power</h2>
      <p class="feature">
        At 3rd level, you harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within yourself.
        This energy is represented by your Psionic Dice, which are each a d4.
        You have a number of these dice equal to half of your Fighter level +
        your Intelligence modifier, and they fuel various psionic powers you
        have, which are detailed below. Some of your powers expend the Psi Die
        they use, as specified in a power's description, and you can't use a
        power if it requires you to use a die when your dice are all expended.
        You regain all your expended Psi Dice when you finish a long rest. In
        addition, as a bonus action, you can regain one expended Psi Die, but
        you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest. When you
        reach certain levels in this class, the size of your Psionic Energy dice
        increases at 7th level (d6), 13th level (d8), and 18th level (d10).The
        powers below use your Psi Dice
      </p>
      <p class="feature-subheader"><strong>Protective Field</strong></p>
      <p class="feature">
        When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes
        damage, you can use your reaction to expend one Psionic Energy die, roll
        the die, and reduce the damage taken by the number rolled plus your
        Intelligence modifier (minimum reduction of 1), as you create a
        momentary shield of telekinetic force.
      </p>
      <p class="feature-subheader"><strong>Psionic Strike</strong></p>
      <p class="feature">
        Psionic Strike You can propel your weapons with psionic force. Once on
        each of your turns, immediately after you hit a target within 30 feet of
        you with an attack and deal damage to it with a weapon, you can expend
        one Psionic Energy die, rolling it and dealing force damage to the
        target equal to the number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier.
      </p>
      <p class="feature-subheader"><strong>Telekinetic Movement</strong></p>
      <p class="feature">
        You can move an object or a creature with your mind. As an action, you
        target one loose object that is Large or smaller or one willing
        creature, other than yourself. If you can see the target and it is
        within 30 feet of you, you can move it up to 30 feet to an unoccupied
        space you can see. Alternatively, if it is a Tiny object, you can move
        it to or from your hand. Either way, you can move the target
        horizontally, vertically, or both. Once you take this action, you can't
        do so again until you finish a short or long rest, unless you expend a
        Psionic Energy die to take it again.
      </p>

        abilities, detailed below.
      </p>
      <p class="feature-subheader"><strong>Psi Powered Leap</strong></p>
      <p class="feature">
        Psi-Powered Leap As a bonus action, you can propel your body with your
        mind. You gain a flying speed equal to twice your walking speed until
        the end of the current turn. Once you take this bonus action, you can't
        do so again until you finish a short or long rest, unless you expend a
        Psionic Energy die to take it again.

      <p class="feature-subheader"><strong>Telekinetic Thrust</strong></p>
      <p class="feature">
        Telekinetic Thrust When you deal damage to a target with your Psionic
        Strike, you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw against
        a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.
        If the save fails, you can knock the target prone or move it up to 10
        feet in any direction horizontally.
      </p>

    <!--Guarded Mind-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2 class="feature">Guarded Mind</h2>
      <p class="feature">
        Starting at 10th level, the psionic energy flowing through you has
        bolstered your mind. You have resistance to psychic damage. Moreover, if
        you start your turn charmed or frightened, you can expend a Psi Die and
        end every effect on yourself subjecting you to those conditions.
      </p>

        force. As a bonus action, you can choose creatures, which can include
        you, that you can see within 30 feet of you, up to a number of creatures
        equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one creature). Each of
        the chosen creatures is protected by half cover for 1 minute or until
        you're incapacitated. Once you take this bonus action, you can't do so
        again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend 3 Psi Die to take
        it again.
      </p>

    <div class="feature">
      <h2 class="feature">Telekinetic Master</h2>
      <p class="feature">
        By 18th level, your ability to move creatures and objects with your mind
        is matched by few. You can cast the Telekinesis spell, requiring no
        components, and your spellcasting ability for the spell is Intelligence.
        On each of your turns, while you concentrate on the spell, including the
        turn when you cast it, you can make one attack with a weapon as a bonus
        action. Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can't do so again
        until you finish a long rest, unless you expend 4 Psi Dice to cast it
        again.
