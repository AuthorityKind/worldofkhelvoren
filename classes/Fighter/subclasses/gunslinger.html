      <h2 class="feature">Firearm Proficiency</h2>
      <p class="feature">
        Starting when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain
        proficiency with firearms, allowing you to add your proficiency bonus to
        attacks made with firearms.

    <div class="feature">
      <h2 class="feature">Gunsmithing</h2>
      <p class="feature">
        Upon choosing this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with
        Tinker’s Tools. You may use them to craft ammunition at half the cost,
        repair damaged firearms, or even draft and create new ones
        (DM’sdiscretion). Some extremely experimental and intricate firearms are
        only available through crafting.

    <div class="feature">
      <h2 class="feature">Adept Marksman</h2>
      <p class="feature">
        When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you have an innate sense
        for using your firearms. You have a pool of Grit points, with a total
        number of Grit equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 2). When you
        take a long rest, you regain all spent Grit. You can use Grit for the
        following abilities:
      </p>
      <p class="feature-saveDC">
        &#9679; When you make an attack with a Firearm, you can spend 2 Grit to
        make the attack with advantage.
      </p>
      <p class="feature-saveDC">
        &#9679; When you roll your Superiority Dice in association with a
        maneuver where you use a Firearm, you can spend 1 Grit to roll the
        superiority dice twice and take the higher roll. Alternatively, you can
        spend 2 Grit to then also add your Wisdom Modifier to the roll of your
        Superiority Dice.
      </p>
      <p class="feature-saveDC">
        &#9679; When you make an Insight, Perception, or Intimidation check, you
        can spend 1 Grit to add your Wisdom modifier to the roll.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!--Quick Draw-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2 class="feature">Quick Draw</h2>
      <p class="feature">
        When you reach 7th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to your
        initiative. You can also stow a firearm, then draw another firearm as a
        single object interaction on your turn.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!--Resting Moxie-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2 class="feature">Resting Moxie</h2>
      <p class="feature">
        Also at 7th level, a quick rest lets you recover much of your spent
        energy. When you take a short rest, you regain a number of expended Grit
        points equal to half of your Wisdom Modifier (rounding up) and if you
        spend 1 or more Hit Dice to regain HP, you regain additional HP equal to
        your Fighter Level.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!--Rapid Repair-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2 class="feature">Rapid Repair</h2>
      <p class="feature">
        Upon reaching 10th level, you learn how to quickly attempt to fix a
        jammed gun. You can spend 1 Grit to attempt to repair a misfired (but
        not broken) firearm as a bonus action. Additionally, when your Firearm
        misfires, you can spend 3 Grit to negate the misfire property for that
        attack.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!--Lightning Reload-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2 class="feature">Lightning Reload</h2>
      <p class="feature">
        Starting at 15th level, you can reload any firearm as a bonus action.
        Additionally, when you reduce a creature to 0HP with a Firearm or score
        a critical hit with a Firearm, you regain 1 expended Grit.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!--Viceous Intent-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2 class="feature">Viceous Intent</h2>
      <p class="feature">
        At 18th level, you now critically hit on 19 and 20 with weapon attacks
        made with firearms. Additionally, whenever you score a critical hit on
        an attack with a firearm, the target additionally suffers half of the
        damage from the attack at the end of its next turn.
