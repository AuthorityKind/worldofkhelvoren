    <!--Bonus Proficiency-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2 class="feature">Bonus Proficiency</h2>
      <p class="feature">
        When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one
        of the following skills of your choice: History, Insight, Performance,
        or Persuasion. Alternatively, you learn one language of your choice.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!--Fighting Spirit-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2 class="feature">Fighting Spirit</h2>
      <p class="feature">
        Starting at 3rd level, your intensity in battle can shield you and help
        you strike true. As a bonus action on your turn, you can give yourself
        advantage on all weapon attack rolls until the end of the current turn.
        When you do so, you also gain 5 temporary hit points. The number of hit
        points increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing
        to 10 at 10th level and 15 at 15th level. You can use this feature three
        times. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or
        long rest.
      </p>
      <p class="feature">
        You can alternatively choose to expend to use of Fighting Spirit to
        regain two expended Superiority Dice, and you can expend three
        Superiority Dice to regain a use of Fighting Spirit.
      </p>

    <!--Elegant Courier-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2 class="feature">Elegant Courier</h2>
      <p class="feature">
        Starting at 7th level, your discipline and attention to detail allow you
        to excel in social situations. Whenever you make a Charisma (Persuasion)
        check, you gain a bonus to the check equal to your Wisdom modifier. Your
        self-control also causes you to gain proficiency in Wisdom saving
        throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain
        proficiency in Intelligence of Charisma saving throws (your choice).
      </p>
    </div>

    <!--Tireless Spirit-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2 class="feature">Tireless Spirit</h2>
      <p class="feature">
        Starting at 10th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of
        Fighting Spirit remaining, you regain one use.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!--Rapid Strikes-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2 class="feature">Rapid Strikes</h2>
      <p class="feature">
        Starting at 15th level, you learn to trade accuracy for swift strikes.
        If you take the Attack action on your turn and have advantage on an
        attack roll against one of the targets, you can forgo the advantage for
        that roll to make an additional weapon attack against that target, as
        part of the same action. You can do so no more than once per turn.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!--Strength Before Death-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2 class="feature">Strength Before Death</h2>
      <p class="feature">
        Starting at 18th level, your fighting spirit can delay the grasp of
        death. If you take damage that reduces you to 0 hit points, you can use
        your reaction to delay falling unconscious, and you can immediately take
        an extra turn. While you have 0 hit points during that extra turn,
        taking damage causes death saving throw failures as normal, and three
        death saving throw failures can still kill you. When the extra turn
        ends, you fall unconscious if you still have 0 hit points. Once you use
        this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
