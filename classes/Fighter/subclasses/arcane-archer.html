  <!--Arcane Archer Lore-->
  <div class="feature">
    <h2 class="feature">Arcane Archer Lore</h2>
    <p class="feature">
      At 3rd level, you learn magical theory or some of the secrets of nature,
      typical for practitioners of this elven martial tradition. You choose to
      gain proficiency in either the Arcana or the Nature skill, and you
      choose to learn either the Prestidigitation or Druidcraft cantrip.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!--Arcane Shots-->
  <div class="feature">
    <h2 class="feature">Arcane Shots</h2>
    <p class="feature">
      At 3rd level, you learn to unleash special magical effects with some of
      your shots. When you gain this feature, you learn two Arcane Shot
      options of your choice, from the list at the bottom of the page.
    </p>
    <p class="feautre">
      You can use an Arcane Shot once per turn when you hit a ranged attack
      with a ranged weapon with the Ammunition trait unless otherwise
      specified. You can do so twice before needing a short or long rest to be
      able to do so again, or you may choose to expend two Superiority Dice to
      use this ability once. At 10th-level, you can uses this feature three
      times before needing a short or long rest, and at 18th-level you can use
      it four times before needing a short or long rest.
    </p>
    <p class="feautre">
      You gain an additional Arcane Shot option of your choice when you reach
      the 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th-level of this class. When you gain a level
      in this class, you can replace one Arcane Shot option you know with
      another.
    </p>
    <p class="feautre">
      The Arcane Shot are all magical effects, and each one is associated with
      one of the schools of magic. If an option requires a saving throw, your
      Arcane Shot save DC equals the following:
    </p>
    <p class="feature-saveDC">
      <b>Arcane Shot DC</b>: 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence
      modifier.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!--Magical Arrow-->
  <div class="feature">
    <h2 class="feature">Magical Arrow</h2>
    <p class="feature">
      At 7th level, you gain the ability to infuse arrows with magic. Whenever
      you attack with a weapon that is eligible to use Arcane Shot, the attack
      counts as being magical for overcoming resistances. The magic fades from
      the arrow immediately after it hits or misses its target.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!--Curving Shot-->
  <div class="feature">
    <h2 class="feature">Curving Shot</h2>
    <p class="feature">
      At 7th level, you learn how to direct an errant arrow toward a new
      target. When you make an attack roll with a weapon affected by your
      Magic Arrow feature and miss, you can use a bonus action to reroll the
      attack roll against a different target within 60 feet of the original
      target.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!--Arcane Reassment-->
  <div class="feature">
    <h2 class="feature">Arcane Reassment</h2>
    <p class="feature">
      At 10th level, you add your Intelligence Modifier to the Damage of your
      Arcane Shots, and when your Arcane Shots deal damage, you can choose to
      expend a Superiority Die and add it to the damage of the Arcane Shot, as
      long as you haven't used a Maneuver with the attack that hit with the
      Arcane Shot.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!--Ever Ready Shot-->
  <div class="feature">
    <h2 class="feature">Ever-Ready Shot</h2>
    <p class="feature">
      Starting at 15th level, your magical archery is available whenever
      battle starts. When you roll initiative, and you have expended one or
      more uses of your Arcane Shot ability, you regain one use of it.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!--Aim of Mysticism-->
  <div class="feature">
    <h2 class="feature">Aim of Mysticism</h2>
    <p class="feature">
      The magic and moxie you strike with are bleeding together, letting your
      magical strikes be nigh unavoidable. Starting at 18th level, the DC for
      your Arcane Shots is increased by half of your Dexterity Modifier
      (rounding up), and you can now use your Arcane Shot more than once per
      turn but the Arcane Shot feature can only be used once per attack.
    </p>

  <!--Arcane Shot Options-->
  <div class="propperty">
    <h2 class="propperty">Arcane Shot Options</h2>
    <section class="container">
      <article class="index">
        <h2 class="feature">Banishing Arrow</h2>
        <p class="feature">
          You use abjuration magic to try to temporarily banish your target to
          a harmless location in the Feywild. The creature hit by the arrow
          must also succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished. While
          banished in this way, its speed is 0, and it is incapacitated. At
          the end of its next turn, the target reappears in the space it
          vacated or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is
          occupied.
        </p>
        <p class="feature">
          When you reach 10th-level, you also deal 1d6 Force damage to the
          target, which increases to 2d6 Force damage at 18th-level.
        </p>
        <h2 class="feature">Beguiling Arrow</h2>
        <p class="feature">
          Your enchantment magic causes this arrow to temporarily beguile its
          target. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 psychic
          damage and choose one of your allies within 30 feet of the target.
          The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it is charmed
          by the chosen ally until the start of your next turn. This effect
          ends early if the chosen ally attacks the charmed target, deals
          damage to it, or forces it to make a saving throw.
        </p>
        <p class="feature">
          The psychic damage increases to 3d6 when you reach 10th-level and
          increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th-level.
        </p>
        <h2 class="feature">Bursting Arrow</h2>
        <p class="feature">
          You imbue your arrow with force energy drawn from the school of
          evocation. The arrow detonates after your attack. Immediately after
          the arrow hits the creature, the target and all other creatures
          within 10 feet of it take 2d6 force damage each.
        </p>
        <p class="feature">
          The force damage increases to 3d6 when you reach 10th-level and
          increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th-level.
        </p>
        <h2 class="feature">Enfeebling Arrow</h2>
        <p class="feature">
          You weave necromantic magic into your arrow. The creature hit by the
          arrow takes an extra 2d6 necrotic damage. The target must also
          succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the damage dealt by its
          weapon attacks is halved until the start of your next turn.
        </p>
        <p class="feature">
          The necrotic damage increases to 3d6 when you reach 10th-level and
          increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th-level.
        </p>

        <h2 class="feature">Gravitational Arrow</h2>
        <p class="feature">
          Your arrow carries immense graviturgy magic with it. The creature hit by the arrow takes 1d6 extra force
          damage, and must make a Strength Save. If they fail, they are violently pulled or pushed 30ft in a straight
          line in a direction of your choosing. If the target creature colides into an obejct or other creature while
          being pushed and they moved more than 10ft, they take falling damage as if they had fallen, where the distance
          they traveled counts as the distance they fell. If they succeeded the save, they are not moved.
        </p>
        <p class="feature">
          The force damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 10th-level and
          increases to 3d6 when you reach 18th-level.
        </p>

      </article>
      <article class="index" id="article-align">
        <h2 class="feature">Grasping Arrow</h2>
        <p class="feature">
          When this arrow strikes its target, conjuration magic creates
          grasping, poisonous brambles, which wrap around the target. The
          creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 poison damage, its
          speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it takes 2d6 slashing damage the
          first time on each turn it moves 1 foot or more without teleporting.
          The target or any creature that can reach it can use its action to
          remove the brambles with a successful Athletics check against your
          Arcane Shot save DC. Otherwise, the brambles last for 1 minute or
          until you use this option again.
        </p>
        <p class="feature">
          The poison and slashing damage increases to 3d6 when you reach
          10th-level and increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th-level.
        </p>

        <h2 class="feature">Infringing Arrow</h2>
        <p class="feature">
          You use chronomancy magic to freeze your target in place, frozen solid in time at the moment they were hit
          with the arrow. The creature hit by this arrow has to make a Charisma Save, and if they fail, they become
          petrified for 1 minute, where the follow the normal rules for being pretrified except their weight is the same
          and they are immune to all damage instead of being resisitant. You may end the this state early with a bonus
          action. When the effect ends, they take 2d6 force damage, and if the succeeded on the saving throw, they
          instead just take half of that damage.
        </p>
        <p class="feature">
          The force damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 10th-level and
          increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th-level.
        </p>

        <h2 class="feature">Piercing Arrow</h2>
        <p class="feature">
          You use transmutation magic to give your arrow an ethereal quality.
          When you use this option, you don’t make an attack roll for the
          attack. Instead, the arrow fires forward in a line, which is 1 foot
          wide and 30 feet long, before disappearing. The arrow passes
          harmlessly through objects, ignoring cover. Each creature in that
          line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a
          creature takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra
          1d6 piercing damage. On a successful save, a target takes half as
          much damage.
        </p>
        <p class="feature">
          The piercing damage increases to 3d6 when you reach 10th-level and
          increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th-level.
        </p>
        <h2 class="feature">Seeking Arrow</h2>
        <p class="feature">
          Using divination magic, you grant your arrow the ability to seek out
          your target, allowing the arrow to curve and twist its path in
          search of its prey. When you use this option, you don’t make an
          attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have
          seen in the past minute. The arrow flies toward that creature,
          moving around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters cover
          and half cover. If the target is within the weapon’s range and there
          is a path large enough for the arrow to travel to the target, the
          target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it
          takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra 1d6 force
          damage, and you learn the target’s current location. On a successful
          save, the target takes half as much damage, and you don’t learn its
          location.
        </p>
        <p class="feature">
          The psychic damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 10th-level and
          increases to 3d6 when you reach 18th-level.
        </p>
        <h2 class="feature">Shadow Arrow</h2>
        <p class="feature">
          You weave illusion magic into your arrow, causing it to occlude your
          foe’s vision with shadows. The creature hit by the arrow takes an
          extra 2d6 psychic damage, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving
          throw or be unable to see anything farther than 5 feet away until
          the start of your next turn.
        </p>
        <p class="feature">
          The psychic damage increases to 3d6 when you reach 10th-level and
          increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th-level.
