    <p>
      When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the
      ability to cast spells.
    </p>
    <p id="subheader"><strong>Cantrips</strong></p>
    <p>
      You learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You
      learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.
    </p>
    <p id="subheader"><strong>Spell Slots </strong></p>
    <p>
      The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you
      have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these
      spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You
      regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For
      example, if you know the 1st-level spell Shield and have a 1st-level and
      a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast Shield using either slot.
    </p>
    <p id="subheader">
      <strong>Spells known of 1st level and higher</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you
      must choose from the abjuration and evocation spells on the wizard spell
      list. The Spells Known column of the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table
      shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of
      these spells must be an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice and
      must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when
      you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or
      2nd level. The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come
      from any school of magic. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you
      can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your
      choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for
      which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation
      spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 3rd,8th, 14th, or
      20th level from any school of magic.
    </p>
    <p id="subheader"><strong>Spell Casting Ability</strong></p>
    <p>
      Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since
      you learn your spells through study and memorization. You use your
      Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
      addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving
      throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with
      one.
    </p>
    <p id="saveDC">
      <b>Spell Save DC</b>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence
      modifier
    </p>
    <p id="saveDC">
      <b>Spell attack modifier</b>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence
      modifier
    </p>
  </div>

  <!--Weapon Bond-->
  <div class="feature">
    <h2>Weapon Bond</h2>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, you learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between
      yourself and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1
      hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within
      your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch
      the weapon and forge the bond. Once you have bonded a weapon to
      yourself, you can't be disarmed of that weapon unless you are
      incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon
      that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport
      instantly to your hand. You can have up to two bonded weapons but can
      summon only one at a time with your bonus action. If you attempt to bond
      with a third weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other two.
      You can also use your Bonded weapons as a spellcasting focus for your
      Eldritch Knight and Wizard Spells.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!--War Magic-->
  <div class="feature">
    <h2>War Magic</h2>
    <p>
      Beginning at 7th level, when you take the attack action, you can replace
      one of your attacks with a cantrip. Additionally, when you cast a spell
      that includes an Attack Roll or weapon attack, you may use your
      Manuerves with that spell as if it were a weapon attack.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!--Eldritch Strikes-->
  <div class="feature">
    <h2>Eldritch Strikes</h2>
    <p>
      At 10th level, you learn how to make your weapon strikes undercut a
      creature's resistance to your spells. When you hit a creature with a
      weapon attack, that creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw
      it makes against a spell you cast before the end of your next turn.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!--Arcane Charge-->
  <div class="feature">
    <h2>Arcane Charge</h2>
    <p>
      At 15th level, you can intersect your martial prowess with a fling of
      magic. When you take the attack action as an action, you may cast a
      spell as a bonus action if its normal casting time is an Action. You can
      only do this once and need to take a short or long rest to be able to do
      so. Alternatively, you can spend 3 Superiority Dice to use this ability
      again even without having taken a short or long rest first.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!--Greater War Magic-->
  <div class="feature">
    <h2>Greater War Magic</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 18th level, when you take the attack action, you can replace
      two attacks with casting a spell of 1st level or higher. You can only do this once per turn.
    </p>
