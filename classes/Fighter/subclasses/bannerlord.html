  <!--Fanfare-->
  <div class="feature">
    <h2>Fanfare</h2>
    <p>
      When you take this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one
      of the following instruments: bagpipes, drum, flute, or horn, where you
      also get proficiency in land vehicles if you don't already have it. When
      you roll initiative, you and each ally that can see or hear you within
      60 feet add your Charisma modifier (a minimum of 1) to its initiative
      roll.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!--Rasie the Colors-->
  <div class="feature">
    <h2>Rasie the Colors</h2>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, your allies rally to you. You can use a bonus action to
      raise a banner, flag, pennant, or other eye-catch which you hold in one
      or both hands to bolster yourself and your allies. When you do so,
      choose one of the benefits below. You and each friendly creature within
      15ft of you gain that benefit for 1 minute until you drop or sheathe
      the eye-catch, you use this feature again, or you become incapacitated. You
      can only provide one benefit from Raise the Colors at a time. You can
      use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a
      minimum of once), and regain all expended uses at the end of a long
      rest. Alternatively, you can expend a Superiority Die to regain a use of this ability.
    </p>
    <p id="indent">&bull; <strong>But Not This Day</strong>. Each affected creature gains temporary hit points equal to
      your Fighter level + your Charisma modifier.
    </p>
    <p id="indent">&bull; <strong>Draw Your Weapons</strong>. When an affected creature is attacked and another affected
      creature is within 5 feet of it, the latter can use its reaction to become the target of the attack instead.
    </p>
    <p id="indent">&bull; <strong>Do Not Show Weakness</strong>. Each affected creature can add your Charisma modifier
      (a minimum of 1) to its death saving throws.
    </p>
    <p id="indent">&bull; <strong>Know No Fear</strong>. Each affected creature has advantage on saving throws against
      being frightened.
    </p>
    <p id="indent">&bull; <strong>Hold The Line</strong>. Each affected creature can add your Charisma modifier (a
      minimum of 1) to its Strength ability and skill checks.
    </p>
    <p id="indent">&bull; <strong>Into The Jaws Of Oblivion</strong>. Each affected creature's speed increases by 10ft.
    </p>
    <p id="indent">&bull; <strong>Show No Mercy</strong>. When an affected creature rolls a 1 on a damage die for an
      attack with a weapon, it can reroll the die and must use the new roll.

  <!--Highrider-->
  <div class="feature">
    <h2>Highrider</h2>
    <p>At 7th level, your banneret training comes to the forefront. You gain the following benefits:</p>
    <p id="indent">&bull; You gain proficiency in two of the following skills: Animal Handling, History,
      Insight, Performance, or Persuasion.</p>
    <p id="indent">&bull; You also have advantage on saving throws against being knocked off a mount. If you fall off a
      mount and fall no more than 10ft, you are not knocked prone so long as you are not incapacitated.</p>
    <p id="indent">&bull; Mounting and dismounting a creature costs you 5ft of movement.</p>
    <p id="indent">&bull; When you are mounted, the range of Raise the Colors' benefits increases to 60ft, instead of
      15ft.</p>
  </div>

  <!--Lead the Charge-->
  <div class="feature">
    <h2>Lead the Charge</h2>
    <p>
      Begining at 10th level, your battle brothers and sisters become greatly inspired when seeing you fight on the
      front lines. When you perform a maneuver as part of a weapon attack, you can choose to have a number of friendly
      creatures equal to your Charisma Modifier within 15ft of you who can see and hear you benefit from one of the
      effects of Raise the Colors until the start of your next turn. You do not need to have wield your eye-catch to do
      so, and they do not count towards the number of benefits a creature can benefit from of your Raise the Colors
      ability.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!--Unquechenable Morale-->
  <div class="feature">
    <h2>Unquechenable Morale</h2>
    <p>
      Beginning at 15th level, when you use your Battle Ready feature, you also regain a number of expend uses of Raise
      the Colors equal to half of your Charisma Modifier (rounding up). You can also choose two benefits of Raise the
      Colors, instead of one.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!--Lead from the Front-->
  <div class="feature">
    <h2>Lead from the Front</h2>
    <p>
      Starting at 18th level, when you persevere and access the well of
      strength hidden deep within, so can your allies. Whenever you use your
      Action Surge, one ally of your choice within 60 feet that can see or
      hear you can take an action as if it were their turn. They do so either right after or before
      you have taken your action you got from Action Surge (your choice).
