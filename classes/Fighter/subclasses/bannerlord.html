        When you take this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one
        of the following instruments: bagpipes, drum, flute, or horn, where you
        also get proficiency in land vehicles if you don't already have it. When
        you roll initiative, you and each ally that can see or hear you within
        60 feet add your Charisma modifier (a minimum of 1) to its initiative
        roll.

        At 3rd level, your allies rally to you. You can use a bonus action to
        raise a banner, flag, pennant, or other eye-catch which you hold in one
        or both hands to bolster yourself and your allies. When you do so,
        choose one of the benefits below. You and each friendly creature within
        15 feet of you gain that benefit for 1 minute until you drop or sheathe
        the eye-catch, you use this feature again, or you are incapacitated. You
        can only provide one benefit from Raise the Colors at a time. You can
        use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a
        minimum of once), and regain all expended uses at the end of a long
        rest.

        At 7th level, your banneret training comes to the forefront. You gain
        proficiency in two of the following skills: Animal Handling, History,
        Insight, Performance, or Persuasion. You also have advantage on saving
        throws against being knocked off a mount. If you fall off a mount and
        fall no more than 10 feet, you are not knocked prone so long as you are
        not incapacitated. Mounting and dismounting a creature costs you 5 feet
        of movement, and you can choose to have attacks against your mount
        target you instead. Finally, when you are mounted, the range of Raise
        the Colors' effects increases to 60 feet.

        The first time you or a charging ally come within 5 feet of a hostile

        make a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your
        Strength modifier). On a failed save, the target falls prone unless it
        is two or more sizes larger than the charging creature. You can use this
        feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of
        once), and regain all expended uses at the end of a long rest.

        Starting at 18th level, when you persevere and access the well of
        strength hidden deep within, so can your allies. Whenever you use your
        Action Surge, one ally of your choice within 60 feet that can see or
        hear you can take an additional action. They do so right after or before
        you have taken your action you got from Action Surge (your choice).
