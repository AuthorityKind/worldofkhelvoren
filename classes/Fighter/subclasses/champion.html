      Also when you choose this subclass, you can for a brief moment call upon your most peerless training. When you use
      your Action Surge feature, and the extra action on an Attack action, you may use a Maneuver you know as part of
      the attacks of that Action, without having to expend a Superiority Die.

    <h2>Unconquerable</h2>
    <p>
      At 10th level, you seem to show unwavering fortitude in the moments you over overcome adversity. When you use your
      Indomitable feature, you roll your Superiority Die twice and choose either roll. Additionally, after you have
      succeeded in a Saving Throw where you used your Indomitable feature, you then also gain advantage on all saving
      throws until the end of your next turn.

      needs. When you take a long rest, you can choose to replace a number of Maneuvers equal to half your Strength or
      Dexterity Modifier (your choice), rounding up, that you know with a different Maneuver. Additionally, as a Bonus
      Action, you can replace a Maneuver you know with a different Maneuver. You need to take a long rest to be able to
      do this again.
