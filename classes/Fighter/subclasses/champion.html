        As a Champion, you are the master of utilizing the tricks and motions of
        your training. When you choose this subclass, you gain an additional
        Superiority Die and you gain an additional Superiority Die above that at
        10th level. Additionally, when you roll your Superiority Die, and you
        roll less than 3, the roll is instead equal to 3. This increases to 4 at
        7th level, 5 at 13th level and 6 at 18th level.
