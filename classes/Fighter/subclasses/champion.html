    <p class="feature">
      Also when you choose this subclass, you can for a brief moment call upon your most peerless training. When you use
      your Action Surge feature, and the extra action on an Attack action, you may use a Maneuver you know as part of
      the attacks of that Action, without having to expend a Superiority Die.
    </p>

      Lastly, also when you choose this subclass, you have the ability to get a read on your opponent simply by battling
      them. When you have hit a weapon attack against a creature or a creature have hit you with a weapon attack, you
      can use your reaction to use your Know Your Enemy feature, targeting that creature.

      At 7th level, the techniques at your disposal deepens even greater. You gain an additional Fighting Style, that
      you don't already have, that is available to the Fighter.

  <!--Unconquerable-->
  <div class="feature">
    <h2 class="feature">Unconquerable</h2>
    <p class="feature">
      At 10th level, you seem to show unwavering fortitude in the moments you over overcome adversity. When you use your
      Indomitable feature, you roll your Superiority Die twice and choose either roll. Additionally, after you have
      succeeded in a Saving Throw where you used your Indomitable feature, you then also gain advantage on all saving
      throws until the end of your next turn.

    <p class="feature">
      At 15th level, the rhythms of the fight are so innate to you, that you can alter you way of fighting to suit your
      needs. When you take a long rest, you can choose to replace a number of Maneuvers equal to half your Strength or
      Dexterity Modifier (your choice), rounding up, that you know with a different Maneuver. Additionally, as a Bonus
      Action, you can replace a Maneuver you know with a different Maneuver. You need to take a long rest to be able to
      do this again.
