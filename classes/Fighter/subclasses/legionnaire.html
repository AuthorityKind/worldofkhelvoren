      The Legionnaires are heavily armored defensive masters, fighting in tight
      formations alongside their shield brothers and protecting one another with
      their massive tower shields. Often originating as soldiers in professional
      armies, mercenary companies, or even bodyguards for nobles and royalty,
      Legionnaires make excellent adventurers as they find themselves as the
      backbone of any party, bolstering their allies and driving them to keep up
      the fight, shielding them from harm, and holding the line of battle so
      nothing can pass. Some even become so experienced with their polished
      shields that they find they can deflect some spells back at their
      attackers.

    <!--Tortoise Formation-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2>Tortoise Formation</h2>
      <p>
        At 3rd level, while wielding a shield you can use a bonus action to
        assume a defensive stance. Your speed drops to 0, your AC increases by
        1, and ranged attacks against you are made at a disadvantage. This bonus
        lasts until the beginning of your next turn. You may not activate this
        feature if you have moved more than half your speed during the current
        round
      </p>
    </div>

    <!--Standard Bearer-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2>Standard Bearer</h2>
      <p>
        Staring at 7th level you are a beacon of courage on the battlefield, and
        your allies are emboldened knowing you are fighting beside them. You may
        shout words of encouragement, wave a banner or standard, or let out a
        war-cry, reminding your companions what they are fighting for. As a
        bonus action, you and all conscious allies within 30 feet of you that
        can see you gain temporary HP equal to half your Fighter level. You can
        only do this once and need to take a short or long rest to be able to do
        it again. At 15th level, the temporary HP is instead equal to your
        Fighter level.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!--Brothers in Arms-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2>Brothers in Arms</h2>
      <p>
        Starting at 10th level, when an ally adjacent to you is attacked you may
        use your reaction to replace their AC with your own. If the attack still
        hits your ally, then you regain your expended reaction.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!--Hold Steady-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2>Hold Steady</h2>
      <p>
        Starting at 15th level, when you use Tortoise Formation on your turn,
        all terrain in a 10ft radius of you is considered difficult terrain for
        your enemies until the start of your next turn.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!--Bulwark-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2>Bulwark</h2>
      <p>
        When your shield is raised, you stand nearly untouchable. At 18th level,
        when your Tortoise Formation is active, your AC bonus from it becomes
        +2, you have advantage on Strength and Constitution Saves, and you have
        advantage on, and add a + 4 to, Dexterity Saves made to determine
        whether you take half of full damage, like from a dragons breath.
        Additionally, activating your Tortoise Formation no longer requires a
        Bonus Action and you can activate at any time on your turn. You may also
        have it activate when you roll initiave.
