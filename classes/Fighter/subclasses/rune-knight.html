      Starting at 3rd level, you can use magic runes to enhance your gear. You
      learn two runes of your choice, from among the runes described below,
      and each time you gain a level in this class, you can replace one rune
      you know with a different one from this feature. When you reach certain
      levels in this class, you learn additional runes, as shown in the Runes
      Known table.

      Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a number of objects equal
      to the number of runes you know, and you inscribe a different rune onto
      each of the objects. To be eligible, an object must be a weapon, a suit
      of armor, a shield, a piece of jewelry, or something else you can wear
      or hold in a hand. Your rune remains on an object until you finish a
      long rest, and an object can bear only one of your runes at a time. The
      following runes are available to you when you learn a rune. If a rune
      has a level requirement, you must be at least that level in this class
      to learn the rune. If a rune requires a saving throw, your Rune
      Magic Save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution
      modifier.

          <h2>Cloud Rune</h2>
          <p>
            This rune emulates the deceptive magic used by some cloud giants. While
            wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have
            advantage on Sleight of Hand checks and Deception checks. In addition,
            when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is hit by an
            attack roll, you can use your reaction to invoke the rune and choose a
            different creature within 30 feet of you, other than the attacker. The
            chosen creature becomes the target of the attack, using the same roll.
            This magic can transfer the attack's effects regardless of the attack's
            range. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish
            a short or long rest.

          <p>
            This rune's magic channels the judiciousness associated with stone
            giants. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune,
            you have advantage on Insight checks, and you have darkvision out to a
            range of 120 feet. In addition, when a creature you can see ends its
            turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to invoke the rune
            and force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. Unless the save
            succeeds, the creature is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed in
            this way, the creature has a speed of 0 and is incapacitated, descending
            into a dreamy stupor. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end
            of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Once you invoke
            this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

            Fire Rune This rune's magic channels the masterful craftsmanship of
            great smiths. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this
            rune, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make
            that uses your proficiency with a tool. In addition, when you hit a
            creature with an attack using a weapon, you can invoke the rune to
            summon fiery shackles: the target takes an extra 2d6 fire damage, and it
            must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained for 1 minute.
            While restrained by the shackles, the target takes 2d6 fire damage at
            the start of each of its turns. The target can repeat the saving throw
            at the end of each of its turns, banishing the shackles on a success.
            Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a

            This rune's magic bestows a resilience reminiscent of a hill giant.
            While wearing or carrying an object that bears this rune, you have
            advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you have
            resistance against poison damage. In addition, you can invoke the rune
            as a bonus action, gaining resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and
            slashing damage for 1 minute. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so

            wilderness, such as frost giants. While wearing or carrying an object
            inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Animal Handling checks
            and Intimidation checks. In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus
            action to increase your sturdiness. For 10 minutes, you gain a +2 bonus
            to all ability checks and saving throws that use Strength or
            Constitution. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you
            finish a short or long rest.

            While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have
            advantage on Arcana checks, and you can't be surprised as long as you
            aren't incapacitated. In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus
            action to enter a prophetic state for 1 minute or until you're
            incapacitated. Until the state ends, when you or another creature you
            can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or
            an ability check, you can use your reaction to cause the roll to have
            advantage or disadvantage. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so

      At 7th level, you learn to invoke your rune magic to protect your
      allies. When another creature you can see within 60 feet of you is hit
      by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to
      reroll the d20 and use the new roll. You can use this feature a number
