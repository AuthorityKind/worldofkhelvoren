        Starting at 3rd level, you can use magic runes to enhance your gear. You
        learn two runes of your choice, from among the runes described below,
        and each time you gain a level in this class, you can replace one rune
        you know with a different one from this feature. When you reach certain
        levels in this class, you learn additional runes, as shown in the Runes
        Known table.

        Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a number of objects equal
        to the number of runes you know, and you inscribe a different rune onto
        each of the objects. To be eligible, an object must be a weapon, a suit
        of armor, a shield, a piece of jewelry, or something else you can wear
        or hold in a hand. Your rune remains on an object until you finish a
        long rest, and an object can bear only one of your runes at a time. The
        following runes are available to you when you learn a rune. If a rune
        has a level requirement, you must be at least that level in this class
        to learn the rune. If a rune requires a saving throw, your Rune
        Magic Save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution
        modifier.
      </p>
      <p class="feature-subheader"><strong>Cloud Rune</strong></p>
      <p class="feature">
        This rune emulates the deceptive magic used by some cloud giants. While
        wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have
        advantage on Sleight of Hand checks and Deception checks. In addition,
        when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is hit by an
        attack roll, you can use your reaction to invoke the rune and choose a
        different creature within 30 feet of you, other than the attacker. The
        chosen creature becomes the target of the attack, using the same roll.
        This magic can transfer the attack's effects regardless of the attack's
        range. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish
        a short or long rest.
      </p>
      <p class="feature-subheader"><strong>Fire Rune</strong></p>
      <p class="feature">
        Fire Rune This rune's magic channels the masterful craftsmanship of
        great smiths. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this
        rune, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make
        that uses your proficiency with a tool. In addition, when you hit a
        creature with an attack using a weapon, you can invoke the rune to
        summon fiery shackles: the target takes an extra 2d6 fire damage, and it
        must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained for 1 minute.
        While restrained by the shackles, the target takes 2d6 fire damage at
        the start of each of its turns. The target can repeat the saving throw
        at the end of each of its turns, banishing the shackles on a success.
        Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a
        short or long rest.
      </p>
      <p class="feature-subheader"><strong>Forst Rune</strong></p>
      <p class="feature">
        This rune's magic evokes the might of those who survive in the wintry
        wilderness, such as frost giants. While wearing or carrying an object
        inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Animal Handling checks
        and Intimidation checks. In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus
        action to increase your sturdiness. For 10 minutes, you gain a +2 bonus
        to all ability checks and saving throws that use Strength or
        Constitution. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you
        finish a short or long rest.
      </p>
      <p class="feature-subheader"><strong>Stone Rune</strong></p>
      <p class="feature">
        This rune's magic channels the judiciousness associated with stone
        giants. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune,
        you have advantage on Insight checks, and you have darkvision out to a
        range of 120 feet. In addition, when a creature you can see ends its
        turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to invoke the rune
        and force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. Unless the save
        succeeds, the creature is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed in
        this way, the creature has a speed of 0 and is incapacitated, descending
        into a dreamy stupor. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end
        of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Once you invoke
        this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
      </p>
      <p class="feature-subheader">
        <strong>Hill Rune <i>(7th-Level or higher)</i></strong>
      </p>
      <p class="feature">
        This rune's magic bestows a resilience reminiscent of a hill giant.
        While wearing or carrying an object that bears this rune, you have
        advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you have
        resistance against poison damage. In addition, you can invoke the rune
        as a bonus action, gaining resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and
        slashing damage for 1 minute. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so
        again until you finish a short or long rest.
      </p>
      <p class="feature-subheader">
        <strong>Storm Rune <i>(7th-Level or higher)</i></strong>
      </p>
      <p class="feature">
        Using this rune, you can glimpse the future like a storm giant seer.
        While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have
        advantage on Arcana checks, and you can't be surprised as long as you
        aren't incapacitated. In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus
        action to enter a prophetic state for 1 minute or until you're
        incapacitated. Until the state ends, when you or another creature you
        can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or
        an ability check, you can use your reaction to cause the roll to have
        advantage or disadvantage. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so
        again until you finish a short or long rest.

      <p class="feature-saveDC">

      <p class="feature">
        At 7th level, you learn to invoke your rune magic to protect your
        allies. When another creature you can see within 60 feet of you is hit
        by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to
        reroll the d20 and use the new roll. You can use this feature a number
