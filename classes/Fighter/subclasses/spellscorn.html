        When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one
        of the following skills of your choice: Arcana, History, Religion
      </p>
    </div>

    <!--Null-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2 class="feature">Null</h2>
      <p class="feature">
        When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you manifest a magical dead
        zone around yourself. While you are conscious, you have resistance to
        damage dealt from cantrips and spells cast with a 1st-level slot. At 7th
        level, you also have resistance to damage dealt by spells of 2nd and 3rd
        level, at 10th level, you also have resistance to damage dealt by spells
        of 4th and 5th level, at 15th level, you also have resistance to damage
        dealt by spells of 6th and 7th level, and at 18th level you have
        resistance to all magical damage.
      </p>
      <p class="feature">
        Additionally, when you see a creature cast a spell within 60ft of you,
        you can use your reaction to lower the DC of the spell (if the spell
        involves a Saving Throw to be made) or the attack roll of the spell (if
        the spell involves an attack roll to be made by the caster) by a number
        equal to half of your Fighter Level. You can do this a number of times
        equal to half of your Constitution Modifier (rounding up), and you get
        your uses back after a long rest. Alternatively, you can expend 3
        Supperiorty Dice to regain a use of this ability.
      </p>
      <p class="feature">
        You also have a Null DC, which is used any time a Saving Throw is made
        against any of your Spellscorn Features. Your Null DC is calculated as
        such:
      </p>
      <p class="feature-saveDC">
        <b>Null Save DC</b>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution
        modifier

    <div class="feature">
      <h2 class="feature">Wary Vigiliance</h2>
      <p class="feature">
        Begining at 3rd level, you can get an easy read on the spellcasters,
        knowing what they have at their disposal. When you use your Know Your
        Enemy feature, you can also choose to learn any of the following
        attributes of the target creature, if they are able to cast spells,
        where instead of having it compared to you, you just learn the exact
        number of propperty of that you are learning: the level is the highest
        level spell they are able to cast, the ability score is used for their
        spellscasting, how many remaning spell slots of a given spell slot level
        do they have left, their Spell DC, their Spell Attack Modifier.
      </p>
      <p class="feature">
        When you reach 7th level, and when you have used Know Your Enemy to
        discern what Ability Score is used for their spellcasting, you then gain
        advantage on Saving Throws against spell cast from that creature for 1
        minute. You can only benefit from this ability once at a time.

      <h2 class="feature">Weavecutter</h2>
      <p class="feature">
        Begining at 7th level, you strike through magic effortlessly. Your
        weapon attacks are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming
        resistance. Additionally, when you make a weapon attack roll, you ignore
        any additions the targets AC granted by spells, such as Shield or Mage
        Armor.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!--Evoke the Void-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2 class="feature">Evoke the Void</h2>
      <p class="feature">
        At 7th level, you can momentarily summon the nothingness to sprawl out
        from you. As an Action, you can Evoke the Void, which lasts for 1
        minute, or if you end it early with a Bonus Action. An Aura of Null is
        emit out from you, going out 15ft from you. When you first activate this
        ability, every creature, except yourself, in your Aura of Null has to
        make a Constitution Save against your Null Save DC. If they fail, they
        take your Fighter Level + your Constitution Modifier in Force Damage,
        and half as much if they suceed. Then, while this ability is active, if
        a creature moves into your Aura of Null or ends its turn within your
        Aura of Null, they take Force Damage equal to your Constitution
        Modifier.
      </p>
      <p class="feature">
        Each time a creature, who is capable of casting spells, is damaged by
        this ability, they take additional Force Damage equal to a roll of your
        Supperiorty Die. If a creature, capable of casting spells, is also
        concentrating on a spell, they instead take additional Force Damage
        equal to two rolls of your Supperiorty Die.
      </p>
      <p class="feature">
        You can use this feature once, and need to take a Long Rest to be able
        to use it again.

    <!--Mages' Bane-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2 class="feature">Mages' Bane</h2>
      <p class="feature">
        At 10th level, you wield great powers of nullification, making you
        capable of shutting down magic that only highly gifted magicians should
        be able to. When you score a critical with a weapon attack, and the
        target of your attack is under the effects of a spell, it also suffers
        the effects of having Dispel Magic cast on it, at a level equal to half
        of your Fighter Level (to a maximum of a 9th level spell), where
        Constitution is used as your Spellcasting Ability Score for the purposes
        of the spell.

    <!--Arcane Absorbtion-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2 class="feature">Arcane Absorbtion</h2>
      <p class="feature">
        Also at 10th level, weaker magic is broken down into its most basic
        fundemental components and reformed into a barrier for you. When you are
        affected by a spell of 2nd level or lower, make a DC 10 Constitution
        Ability check. If you succeed, you are completely immune to the effects
        of that spell, and you gain temporary HP equal to your Supperiorty Die +
        Your Consitution Modifer times the spell level. These temporary HP last
        for 1 minute. When you are about to make the Constitution Ability Check,
        you can expend a usage of your Null feature to automatically fail the
        check.
      </p>
      <p class="feature">
        When you reach 15th level, you instead absorb spells of 3rd level or
        lower, and when you reach 18th level, you instead absorb spell of 4th
        level or lower.
      </p>

    <!--Relic Breaker-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2 class="feature">Relic Breaker</h2>
      <p class="feature">
        At 15th level, you can corrode the magic that flows through enchanted
        items and treasures. As an action, you can touch a magic item and make a
        Constitution Ability Check, and if you suceed, the magic item looses its
        magical propperties for a number of days equal how much your Ability
        Check exceeded the DC by (minimum of 1) and you gain Temporary HP which
        lasts 1 hour. The DC of the Ability Check and the number of Temporary HP
        gained depends on the items variety, and is specified in the table
        below. Alternatively, you can choose to spend 1 minute instead of an
        action to use this ability. Doing so lets you add your Superiority Die
        to the Ability Check made.

        You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution
        Modifer (minimum of 3), where you regain your uses after a Short or Long
        rest. If you use this ability on a magic item with a varierty of Rare or
        Very Rare, it costs two uses instead, and if you use this ability on a
        magic item with a varierty of Legendary or on an Artifact, it costs
        three uses instead.

    <!--Eradication of Magic-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2 class="feature">Eradication of Magic</h2>
      <p class="feature">
        At 18th level, your very touch can rob creatures of their magic,
        potentially having their magical powers leave them for a long time. Once
        per turn as an action, or in place of a weapon attack, you touch one
        creature who can cast spells and force them to make a Constitution Save
        against your Null Save DC. If they fail, they choose spell slots to lose
        until the combined level of spell slots lost equal or exceed your
        Fighter Level + your Constitution Modifer.
      </p>
      <p class="feature">
        For example, if your Fighter Level is 18 and your Constitution Modifier
        is +2, then the target creature must choose a number of spell slots,
        which spell slot level add up to be equal to over exceed your Fighter
        Level + your Constitution Modifier, which in this example is 20. So the
        caster could for example choose to sacrifice four 1st-level spell slots,
        three 2nd-level spells slots, two 3rd-level spell slots and one
        4th-level spell slot, which would have a combined total that is equal to
        this examples Fighter Level + Constitution Modifier, which is 20.
      </p>
      <p class="feature">
        If the target creature is not able to meet or exceed your Fighter Level
        + your Constitution Modifer with the spell slots that they have left,
        they then loose all remaining spell slots and become unable to both cast
        any spell, including spells that do not requirea spell slot to be
        expended, and they become unable to regain spell slots for number of
        days equal to the difference between their remaining spell slots' level
        combined, that could not meet or exceed your Fighter Level + Your
        Constitution Modifier, and your Fighter Level + your Constitution
        Modifier.
      </p>
      <p class="feature">
        You can use this feature once, and need to take a long rest to be able
        to use it again. Alternatively, you can expend four Supperiorty Dice to
        regain a use of this ability.
