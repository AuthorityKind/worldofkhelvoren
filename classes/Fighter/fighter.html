    <!--Fighting Style-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2 class="feature">Fighting Style</h2>
      <p class="feature">
        You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one
        <a href="../universal-features/fighting-styles.html">Fighting Style</a>
        available to the Fighter. You can't take a Fighting Style option more
        than once, even if you later get to choose again. When you reach 13th
        level, you can choose another fighting style.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!--Combat Superiority-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2 class="feature">Combat Superiority</h2>
      <p class="feature">
        Beginning at 1st level, your skill with the armaments of war sets you
        apart from other warriors, even other adventurers. This skill with arms
        is represented with special maneuvers that you can use in combination
        with your attacks, and are fueled with a pool of special superiority
        dice. See the end of this class description for a list of maneuvers.
      </p>
      <p class="feature-subheader"><strong>Superiority Dice</strong></p>
      <p class="feature">
        You gain three superiority dice, which are d6's, that represent your
        skill in battle. To use a maneuver you must expend one of these dice,
        and you regain all expended superiority dice when you finish a short or
        long rest. As you gain fighter levels, you gain more superiority dice,
        and your superiority dice increase in size, as indicated in the
        Superiority Dice and Die Size columns of the fighter table.
      </p>
      <p class="feature-subheader"><strong>Manuevers Known</strong></p>
      <p class="feature">
        You learn two <a href="manuevers.html">maneuvers</a> of your choice from
        the list of maneuvers at the end of this class description. The
        Maneuvers Known column of the Fighter table shows when you learn more
        maneuvers of your choice. Additionally, when you gain a level in this
        class, you can choose one of the maneuvers you know and replace it with
        another maneuver of your choice.
      </p>
      <p class="feature-subheader"><strong>Saving Throws</strong></p>
      <p class="feature">
        If a maneuver requires a creature to make a saving throw, your maneuver
        saving throw DC is calculated as follows:
      </p>
      <p class="feature-saveDC">
        <b>Maneuver Save DC</b>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or
        Dexterity modifier (your choice).
      </p>
    </div>

    <!--Action Surge-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2 class="feature">Action Surge</h2>
      <p class="feature">
        Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits
        for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of
        your regular action and a possible bonus action. Once you use this
        feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it
        again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but
        only once on the same turn.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!--Know Your Enemy-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2 class="feature">Know Your Enemy</h2>
      <p class="feature">
        Beginning at 2nd level, you can observe or interact with friends and
        foes alike, learning their strengths and weaknesses in comparison to
        your own. As an action, choose a creature that you can see within 60
        feet, and one of its attributes from the following list: Strength score,
        Dexterity score, Constitution score, Armor Class, current hit points, or
        proficiency bonus. You immediately learn if the creature is your equal,
        superior, or inferior in that regard to the attribute you chose. Once
        you target a creature with this ability, you cannot target that same
        creature again until you finish a long rest. Upon reaching 13th level in
        this class, you can use this feature as either an action or bonus action
        on your turn.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!--Martial Archetype-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2 class="feature">Martial Archetype</h2>
      <p class="feature">
        At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your
        combat styles and techniques. You gain a feature from your archetype
        this level, and then again at 7th, 10th, 15th and 18th level.

    <!--Ability Score Improvement-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2 class="feature">Ability Score Improvement</h2>
      <p class="feature">
        When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and
        19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or
        you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
        can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
        Alternatively, you can take a feat you meet the prerequisites for.
      </p>
      <p class="feature">
        When you gain Ability Score Improvement from this class, you can do one
        of the following, as you shift the focus of your martial practice:
      </p>
      <p class="feature-saveDC">
        &middot; Replace a fighting style you know with another fighting style
        available to fighters.
      </p>
      <p class="feature-saveDC">
        &middot; You can replace one maneuver you know with a different
        maneuver.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!--Extra Attack-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2 class="feature">Extra Attack</h2>
      <p class="feature">
        Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever
        you take the Attack action on your turn. The number of attacks increases
        to three when you reach 11th level in this class and to four when you
        reach 20th level in this class. If you already have the Extra Attack
        feature from another class, you can gain both one Fighting Style from
        the Fighter and learn an additional Maneuver. If you reach 11th or 20th
        level in this class with Extra Attack from another class, you still gain
        the extra third and fourth attack.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!--Indomitable-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2 class="feature">Indomitable</h2>
      <p class="feature">
        At 9th level, you can persist through most dangers. When you make a
        saving throw that you are proficient in, you expend a superiority die and add it to the saving
        throw. You can do this after you have made the saving throw, but before
        you know the outcome of the roll. Additionally, choose a Saving throw
        you are not Proficient with. You gain proficiency with that Saving
        Throw.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!--Battle Ready-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2 class="feature">Battle Ready</h2>
      <p class="feature">
        Beginning at 13th level, the spark of a fight can light the fire of war
        within you, even when the flames have dwindled. When you roll
        initiative, and you have any number of expended Superiority Dice, you
        can choose to regain a number of expended Superiority Dice equal to half
        of your total number of Superiority Die but it cannot exceed your total
        number of Superiority Dice. You can use this once and need to take a
        Long rest to be able to do so again.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!--Unbreakable Mettle-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2 class="feature">Unbreakable Mettle</h2>
      <p class="feature">
        At 17th level, you can suffer through nearly everything thrown at you.
        When you make a Saving Throw  and you use your Indomitable feature on that Saving Throw, then, if the Saving Throw is
        used to determine if you take full or half damage, you then also take
        only half the damage on a failed save and no damage on a successful
        save. If the effect that you made a Saving Throw against had any other
        effect that occurred when you succeed the Saving Throw, you can choose
        to forego it.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!--Battle Master-->
    <div class="feature">
      <h2 class="feature">Battle Master</h2>
      <p class="feature">
        Beginning at 20th level, you have become the apex combatant. If you roll
        a number lower than either your Strength or Dexterity modifier (you
        choose) on your Superiority Dice, you do not expend a usage of your
        Superiority Die and the dice is instead equal to your Strength or
        Dexterity modifier (you choose). Additionally, once per turn, when you
        use a Maneuver, you can choose to not have to expend a Superiority Die,
        and instead have either your Strength or Dexterity Modifier be the
        result of what would have been your rolled Superiority Die.
