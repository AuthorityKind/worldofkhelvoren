        Philosophy is considered by many to be the purest Discipline
        a savant can pursue. They expend their genius pondering the
        deep questions of existence; the purpose of life, the nature of
        the planes, and the relationship between mortals and gods.
        Through their study of the multiverse, a Philosopher looks to
        perfect their knowledge of the cosmos and their place in it.

            When you join this Academic Discipline at 3rd level, you gain
            proficiency and expertise in both Arcana and Religion. If
            you are already proficient in either skill you gain proficiency
            in another skill of your choice from the Savant skill list.
            Your understanding of the higher levels of reality and the
            planes of the multiverse grants you the following benefits:

        <p class="feature">
            Through years of study, you have uncovered Words of Power
            that were used in the shaping of the multiverse. Starting at
            3rd level, you can expend an Intellect Die as an action and
            speak aloud one of the Words of Power below, focusing on a
            creature that can hear you within 30 feet, forcing it to make a
            saving throw, against your Philosopher save DC:

            <strong>Confound.</strong> You force the target to make an Intelligence
            saving throw. On a failed save, it subtracts your Intelligence
            modifier from the first attack roll it makes on each turn for 1
            minute. It can repeat this saving throw at the start of each of
            its turns, ending the effect on a success.
        </p>
        <p class="feature-saveDC">
            <strong>Disorient.</strong> You force the target to make a Wisdom saving
            throw. On a failed save, it must subtract your Intelligence
            modifier from the next saving throw it is forced to make.
        </p>
        <p class="feature-saveDC">
            <strong>Fear.</strong> You force the target to make a Wisdom saving throw.
            On a failed save, it is frightened of a creature of your choice
            that it can see for 1 minute. It can repeat this saving throw at
            the start of each turn, ending the effect on a success.
        </p>
        <p class="feature-saveDC">
            <strong>Halt.</strong> You force the target to make a Strength saving throw.
            On a failed save, its speed is reduced to 0 for 1 minute. The
            target can repeat this saving throw at the beginning of each
            of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
        </p>
        <p class="feature-saveDC">
            <strong>Shift.</strong> You force two creatures of your choice to make a
            Charisma saving throw. If both targets fail their save, they
            instantly switch places. A creature can willingly fail this save.

            Your sense of purpose and willpower are unyielding. Starting
            at 6th level, when you make an Intelligence or Wisdom saving
            throw to take only half damage from a spell, you can spend an
            Intellect Die to take no damage if you succeed on your saving
            throw, and only half damage if you fail your saving throw.
            You also gain proficiency in Charisma saving throws.

            Words of Power as if you were concentrating on a spell:
        </p>
        <p class="feature-saveDC">
            <strong>Banish.</strong> You force a target to make a Charisma saving
            throw. On a failed save, it is banished for up to 1 minute. If it
            is native to your current plane, it is banished to a harmless
            demiplane. If it is native to another plane, it is banished to its
            native plane. The target can repeat its saving throw at the end
            of each turn. On a success, it returns to an unoccupied space
            nearest to the place it was originally banished from.

            <strong>Enfeeble.</strong> You force a target to make an Intelligence saving
            throw. On a failed save, it is stunned for 1 minute. The target
            can repeat this saving throw at the start of each turn, and
            each time it takes damage, ending the effect on a success.
