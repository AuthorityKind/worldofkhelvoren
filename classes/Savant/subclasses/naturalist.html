        The Naturalist's classroom begins at the edges of civilization.
        They study the natural balance of ecosystems and will go to
        any lengths to maintain that balance. A true Naturalist is a
        protector of the wild and an expert at predicting the weather,
        identifying toxic and medicinal plants, and tracking animals.

        <h2 class="feature">Student of Nature</h2>
        <p class="feature">
            When you join this Academic Discipline at 3rd level, you gain
            proficiency and expertise in Nature and Survival. If
            you are already proficient in either skill you gain proficiency
            in another skill of your choice from the savant skill list
        </p>
        <p class="feature">
            Also, during a long rest, you can spend 1 hour studying and
            taking notes on your environment. So long as you have these
            notes, you have advantage on Intelligence or Wisdom checks
            related to its native animals, plants, weather, and ecosystems.

    <!--Survivalist-->
    <div class="feature">
        <h2 class="feature">Survivalist</h2>
        <p class="feature">
            You have the knowledge and skills to survive and thrive in the
            wild. Starting at 3rd level, as part of a short or long rest, you
            can spend 1 hour gathering materials from the surrounding
            environment to create one of the following items: 10 feet of
            rope, a club, a javelin, 1d4 darts, or a net. To use this ability,
            you need a blade, dagger, or the appropriate artisan's tools.
            You have also learned to set snares. As an action, you can
            spend an Intellect Die to set a snare in an adjacent
            unoccupied 5-foot space. The first creature that moves into
            the space must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against
            your Naturalist save DC or be restrained by your snare.
        </p>
        <p class="feature-saveDC"><b>Naturalist Save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus
            + your Intelligence modifier</p>
        <p class="feature">
            As an action, the restrained creature can repeat the saving
            throw, ending the effect on a success. A creature can detect a
            snare by making a successful Intelligence (Investigation) or
            Wisdom (Perception) check against your Naturalist save DC.
        </p>

    <!--Adapt & Overcome-->
    <div class="feature">
        <h2 class="feature">Adapt & Overcome</h2>
        <p class="feature">
            Starting at 6th level, you can train others to survive in the wild. At the end of each short or long rest,
            you, and a number of creatures equal to your Intelligence
            modifier (minimum of 1 creature), gain one of the following
            features until the end of your next short or long rest
        </p>
        <p class="feature-saveDC">
            <strong>Concealment Training.</strong> While in natural environments,
            creatures can move stealthily at a normal pace and have
            advantage on Stealth checks they make to hide.
        </p>
        <p class="feature-saveDC">
            <strong>Diver Training.</strong> Creatures gain a swimming speed equal to
            their walking speed and can hold their breath underwater for
            a number of minutes equal to their Constitution modifier +
            your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 minute).
        </p>
        <p class="feature-saveDC">
            <strong>Endurance Training.</strong> Creatures can ignore the effects of
            difficult terrain imposed by natural environments and have
            advantage on saving throws to avoid exhaustion
        </p>
        <p class="feature-saveDC">
            <strong>Mountaineer Training.</strong> Creatures gain a climbing speed
            equal to their walking speed and they reduce any falling
            damage they take by an amount equal to your savant level.
        </p>
        <p class="feature-saveDC">
            <strong>Resilience Training.</strong> Creatures have advantage on saving
            throws to resist the effects of extreme environments and gain
            resistance to either cold, fire, poison, or thunder damage
        </p>

    <!--Call of the Wild-->
    <div class="feature">
        <h2 class="feature">Call of the Wild</h2>
        <p class="feature">
            Starting at 13th level, you can tame almost any wild creature.
            As an action, you can force a beast, plant, or monstrosity that
            can hear you within 30 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw
            against your Naturalist save DC or be charmed for 1 hour.
        </p>
        <p class="feature">
            While charmed, the creature is friendly to you and your
            allies and shares your turn in combat. As a bonus action, you
            can issue a simple command to the creature, which it does its
            best to obey. Once it completes a command it will defend
            itself to the best of its ability until you command it again.
        </p>
        <p class="feature">
            Each time the creature takes damage, it can repeat the
            Wisdom saving throw, ending the charm on a success. If you
            are within 30 feet of the creature and it can hear you, you can
            use your reaction to impose disadvantage on its saving throw.
        </p>
        <p class="feature">
            You can only have one creature charmed in this way at a
            time. Attempting to charm a second creature ends the effect
            for the first. You may use this feature a number of times equal
            to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you
            regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
        </p>
