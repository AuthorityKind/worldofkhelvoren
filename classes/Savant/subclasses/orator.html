        Orators are true masters of linguistics and the spoken word.
        These wordsmiths use nothing but their wit and mastery of
        rhetoric to rebuff their foes and empower their allies. With
        utmost confidence, they stride boldly into hostile situations,
        confident that they can win anyone with their eloquence.
        Unlike others who rely on their charm, Orators embolden
        their allies and win over their foes with well-reasoned logic.

            When you adopt this Academic Discipline at 3rd level, you
            gain proficiency and expertise in both Deception and Persuasion. If you are already proficient in either
            skill you gain proficiency in another skill from the savant skill list.
            You studies also gain for you the following benefits:
        </p>
        <p id="indent">
            &bull; You can use your Intelligence, in place of your Charisma,
            whenever you make a Deception or Persuasion check.
        </p>
        <p id="indent">
            &bull; You learn to speak, read, and write a number of extra
            languages equal to your Intelligence modifier.
        </p>
        <p id="indent">
            &bull; When you speak to a creature in its native tongue (other
            than common), you gain a bonus to any Deception or
            Persuasion check you make equal to your Intellect Die.

    <!--Rhetorical Prowess-->
    <div class="feature">
        <h2>Rhetorical Prowess</h2>
        <p>
            Your mastery over the spoken word allows you to dominate,
            inspire, and cajole other creatures who can understand and
            hear you. At 3rd level, you gain the rhetorical abilities listed
            below. If one of these abilities requires a creature to make a
            saving throw, the saving throw DC is calculated as follows:
        </p>
        <p id="saveDC">
            <b>Orator Save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus
            + your Intelligence modifier
        </p>
        <p id="subheader"><strong>Convincing Dialog</strong></p>
        <p>
            If you spend at least 1 minute talking
            to a creature that is not hostile toward you, you can expend
            an Intellect Die to charm it for up to 1 hour. This effect ends
            early if you or your allies do anything harmful to the creature.
        </p>
        <p id="subheader"><strong>Distracting Retort</strong></p>
        <p>
            When a creature within 30 feet of you
            attacks a creature, you can use your reaction to force the
            attacker to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save,
            the creature subtracts your Intellect Die from its attack roll.
        </p>
        <p id="subheader"><strong>Inspiring Word</strong></p>
        <p>
            As an action, you can expend an Intellect
            Die and grant a willing creature you can see within 30 feet
            temporary hit points equal to your Intellect Die roll.
        </p>
        <p id="subheader"><strong>Soothing Speech</strong></p>
        <p>
            As an action, you can spend an Intellect
            Die and force a creature within 30 feet to make a Charisma
            saving throw. On a failed save, it becomes indifferent toward
            creatures of your choice that it was hostile toward for up to 1
            minute. The effect ends if you or an ally harm the creature.
        </p>
        <p id="subheader"><strong>Uplifting Remark</strong></p>
        <p>
            When a creature within 30 feet makes
            an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, you can
            expend an Intellect Die as a reaction, adding it to their roll.

    <!--Logical Mind-->
    <div class="feature">
        <h2>Logical Mind</h2>
        <p>
            Your masterful grasp of logic and rhetoric allows you to
            better resist mind-altering effects. Starting at 6th level, you
            have advantage on any saving throws to resist enchantment
            spells, and you are immune to the charmed condition.
            Additionally, when you use your action to use a rhetorical
            ability, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.
        </p>

    <!--Peerless Rhetoric-->
    <div class="feature">
        <h2>Peerless Rhetoric</h2>
        <p>
            You are able to bend the masses to your will with nothing
            more than your words. At 13th level, you gain the rhetorical
            abilities listed below. You can use each ability once, and you
            cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
        </p>
        <p id="subheader"><strong>Motivational Address</strong></p>
        <p>
            Over the course of 1 minute, you
            speak to a number of creatures equal to your savant level who
            can hear and understand you. They gain temporary hit points
            equal to your savant level. While the temporary hit points
            remain, they have advantage on saving throws to resist
            enchantment spells and they are immune to being frightened.
        </p>
        <p id="subheader"><strong>Definitive Argument</strong></p>
        <p>
            As an action, you speak to a number
            of creatures who can hear and understand you equal to your
            savant level. They must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or
            be charmed by you for the next 24 hours as if by the mass
            suggestion spell. The effect ends if you harm the creature.
            If you were speaking to any of the creatures for at least 1
            minute before using this action, and they were not hostile
            towards you, they have disadvantage on their saving throw.
        </p>

        <p>
            Your absolute mastery over the spoken word allows you to
            bend all but the strongest creatures to your will. Beginning at
            17th level, when you force a creature to make a saving throw
            to resist the effects of one of your rhetorical abilities, it has
            disadvantage on the roll if both its Intelligence and Wisdom
            scores are lower than your Intelligence score.
