        Legends say that rune magic is the most ancient arcane art, passed on be the ancient traditions of the Giants.
        Savants who dedicate their lives to
        the study of these Runes are known as Rune Scribes. They
        learn all they can about these ancient sigils that embody the
        fundamental magic of creation. The magic of Runes is rarely
        used, and jealously guarded by those who can wield its power.

            When you join this Academic Discipline at 3rd level, you gain
            proficiency and expertise in History and with calligrapher's supplies. If you're already proficient in
            History you gain proficiency in another skill from the savant skill list.
            You can also speak, read, and write Giant, and if you already know Giant, you may choose a different
            language to learn.

            At 3rd level, you learn the artful and ancient magic of Runes.
        </p>
        <p class="feature-saveDC">
            <strong>Runes Known.</strong> You know two Runes of your choice from
            the list at the end of this Discipline. Some Runes have a level
            prerequisite, which you can learn when you meet that level.
            You learn an additional Rune of your choice when you
            reach 6th, 10th, 13th, and 17th level in this class.
            When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of
            the Runes you know with another Rune of your choice.

        <p class="feature-saveDC">
            <strong>Inscribing Runes.</strong> During the course of a long rest, you
            can spend 1-hour using calligrapher's supplies to inscribe a
            Rune you know onto a non-magical object, inscribing it in a
            Runic Languages you know. A creature that bears an object
            inscribed with a Rune gains the passive benefit of that Rune
            for as long as they wear or wield the inscribed object.
            A Rune you know can only be inscribed in one object at a
            time, and inscribing it into another object causes the magic
            of any previous inscriptions of that Rune to instantly dispel.

            <strong>Invoking Runes.</strong> A creature that bears an object inscribed
            with one of your Runes can use an action to invoke the Rune.
            A creature must be able to speak the Runic Language of the
            Rune's inscription in order to invoke the Rune's effect.
            Once a Rune has been invoked, it cannot be invoked again
            until the Rune Scribe that inscribed it finishes a long rest.

            ability for your Runes, as you unlocked their power through
            years of research. You use Intelligence when a Rune refers to
            your Runic casting ability, when you set the saving throw DC,
            or when you make an attack roll with one of your Runes.

            level, any object inscribed with one of your Runes counts as
            magical for as long as the magic of the inscribed Rune lasts.
            Also, during the course of a short rest, you can perform a
            short 10-minute ritual to reawaken the magic of a Rune that
            has already been invoked for the day, allowing it to be invoked
            one additional time before the end of your next long rest

            when in need. Starting at 17th level, when you are reduced to
            0 hit points but not killed outright, you can draw on the latent
            power of one of your inscribed Runes, instantly dispelling the
            Rune and any of its effects, to fall to 1 hit point instead.
