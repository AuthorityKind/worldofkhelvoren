        Physicians bring their considerable intellect to bear healing
        the sick and tending to the wounded. They spend their lives
        studying anatomy and the inner workings of mortals, and
        they use this knowledge to keep their allies in top condition.
        Using their medical training, they offer aid to those who don't
        have access to the luxury of divine or arcane healing magic.

        <h2>Student of Medicine</h2>
        <p>
            When you join this Academic Discipline at 3rd level, you gain
            proficiency and expertise in Medicine and with herbalism kits. If you are already proficient in either, you gain
            proficiency with another skill from the savant skill list.
            Moreover, your studies grant you the following benefits:
        </p>
        <p id="indent">
            &bull; You can use Intelligence as the ability score used for Medicine skill checks.
        </p>
        <p id="indent">
            &bull; If you spend at least 1 minute examining a creature, you
            can identify any disease, poison, or curse affecting it.
        </p>
        <p id="indent">
            &bull; Once per turn, when you hit the target of Adroit Analysis
            with a weapon attack, you can reduce its speed by a
            number of feet equal to 5 times your Intelligence modifier
            (minimum of 5 feet) until the beginning of your next turn.

    <!--Combat Medic-->
    <div class="feature">
        <h2>Combat Medic</h2>
        <p>
            You can administer aid in the midst of combat. Beginning at
            3rd level, you can use an Action to use the following abilities:
        </p>
        <p id="subheader"><strong>Adreneline Jolt</strong></p>
        <p>
            A creature you touch can immediately
            repeat a saving throw to end one of the following conditions:
            blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, or poisoned, adding
            your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1) to their roll.
        </p>
        <p id="subheader"><strong>Dress Wounds</strong></p>
        <p>
            You touch a creature and expend an
            Intellect Die, immediately granting it temporary hit points
            equal to your Intellect Die roll + your Intelligence modifier.
        </p>
        <p id="subheader"><strong>Healing Surge</strong></p>
        <p>
            A creature you touch can instantly expend
            one of its Hit Dice to regain hit points equal to its Hit Die roll
            + its Constitution modifier + your Intelligence modifier.
        </p>
        <p id="subheader"><strong>Stabilize</strong></p>
        <p>
            You touch a living creature that has 0 hit points,
            automatically stabilizing them. The target can then choose to
            expend one of their Hit Dice to regain hit points equal to the
            maximum value of that Hit Die + their Constitution modifier.
        </p>

    <div class="feature">
        <h2>Field Doctor</h2>
        <p>
            You can move across the battlefield unscathed. Starting at 6th
            level, when you use your action to stabilize a creature, restore
            hit points, or grant temporary hit points, you gain the benefits
            of the Dodge action until the start of your next turn.
            Additionally, when you use a Combat Medic action on your
            turn, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!--Advanced Combat Medic-->
    <div class="feature">
        <h2>Advanced Combat Medic</h2>
        <p>
            Starting at 13th level, you use your knowledge of medicine to
            perform wondrous feats. As an action, you can touch a willing
            creature and use one of the abilities listed below. You can use
            the abilities below a combined number of times equal to your
            Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all
            expended uses when you finish a long rest
        </p>
        <p id="subheader"><strong>Regeneration</strong></p>
        <p>
            The creature regains hit points equal to
            four rolls of your Intellect Die. If the creature has a severed
            body part, you can reattach it as part of this action.
        </p>
        <p id="subheader"><strong>Restoration</strong></p>
        <p>
            You end one of the following conditions
            currently affecting it: blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened,
            paralyzed, poisoned, a reduction to an ability score or its hit
            point maximum, or you reduce its level of exhaustion by 1.
        </p>
        <p id="subheader"><strong>Resuscitation</strong></p>
        <p>
            If the creature has died within the last
            minute, you return it to life with 1 hit point. You cannot bring
            back a creature that died of old age, nor can you restore any
            body parts the creature is missing.

    <!--Master Physician-->
    <div class="feature">
        <h2>Master Physician</h2>
        <p>
            Your medical knowledge is without peer. Beginning at 17th
            level, whenever you restore hit points or grant temporary hit
            points to a creature, it gains the maximum possible amount
            of hit points, in place of rolling. Also, any creature that expends a Hit Die while within 30
            feet of you treats their Hit Dice as its maximum possible rol
