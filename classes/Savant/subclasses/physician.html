        Physicians bring their considerable intellect to bear healing
        the sick and tending to the wounded. They spend their lives
        studying anatomy and the inner workings of mortals, and
        they use this knowledge to keep their allies in top condition.
        Using their medical training, they offer aid to those who don't
        have access to the luxury of divine or arcane healing magic.
