        Excelling at unraveling mysteries and uncovering secrets,
        Investigators possess an uncanny ability to read the intent of
        others. They often spend their lives working against those
        who deceive the innocent and take advantage of the common
        trust. Their considerable intellect and eye for the truth stand
        in the way of thieves, shapeshifters, and corrupt politicians.

    <!--Student of Truth-->
    <div class="feature">
        <h2>Student of Truth</h2>
        <p>
            When you join this Academic Discipline at 3rd level, you gain
            proficiency and expertise in Insight and Investigation. If
            you are already proficient in either skill you gain proficiency
            in another skill of your choice from the savant skill list.
        </p>
        <p>
            You also have advantage on any ability check you make to
            detect illusions, shapeshifters, or if a creature is lying to you
        </p>
    </div>

    <!--Rough & Tumble-->
    <div class="feature">
        <h2>Rough & Tumble</h2>
        <p>
            You have learned to fight dirty in the underbelly of the world.
            Beginning at 3rd level, your weapon attacks against the target
            of Adroit Analysis score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.
            When you hit the target of Adroit Analysis with an attack,
            you can spend an Intellect Die and force the target to make a
            Constitution saving throw against your Investigator save DC:
        </p>
        <p id="saveDC"><b>Investigator Save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus
            + your Intelligence modifier</p>
        <p>
            On a failed save, it is blinded, deafened, or cannot speak
            (your choice) for 1 minute. It can repeat the saving throw at
            the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you score a critical hit, you use this feature without
            expending an Intellect Die, and the target has disadvantage
            on its initial Constitution saving throw.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!--Astute Defense-->
    <div class="feature">
        <h2>Astute Defense</h2>
        <p>
            You have a heightened sense of danger and can use your
            reflexes to dodge incoming blows. Starting at 6th level, when
            a creature you can see targets you with an attack, you can
            impose disadvantage on their attack roll as a reaction.
            If the triggering attack misses, you can make one weapon
            attack against the attacker as part of the same reaction.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!--Ear to the Ground-->
    <div class="feature">
        <h2>Ear to the Ground</h2>
        <p>
            Your line of work has granted you a unique familiarity with
            the underbelly of the civilized world. At 6th level, you learn to
            speak, read, decode, decipher, and write in Thieves' Cant.
            Also, once you spend a long rest in a settlement, you have
            advantage on any checks you make to gather information on
            that settlement, its culture, factions, or important figures.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!--Peerless Focus-->
    <div class="feature">
        <h2>Peerless Focus</h2>
        <p>
            Your gaze uncovers even the most well-hidden secrets and
            conspiracies. At 13th level, you gain the following benefits:
        </p>
        <p id="indent">&bull; When you make an Investigation or Insight check you can treat a roll of 9 or
            lower as a 10.</p>
        <p id="indent">&bull; You automatically detect and see through illusion spells
            cast at a level equal to your Intelligence modifier or lower.</p>
        <p id="indent">&bull; When you make an ability check or saving throw that uses
            your Dexterity, you can add an Intellect Die to your roll.</p>
        <p id="indent">&bull; Your weapon attacks against the target of Adroit Analysis
            score a critical hit on a roll of 18 through 20 on the d20.</p>
        <p id="indent">&bull; Once per turn, you can choose to re-roll the damage from
            Potent Observation, but you must use the new roll.</p>
    </div>

    <!--Master Investigator-->
    <div class="feature">
        <h2>Master Investigator</h2>
        <p>
            Your eye for the truth has reached near-supernatural levels.
            At 18th level, you gain Truesight in a 60-foot radius. Though,
            you cannot see into the Ethereal Plane within this range.
            Also, when you, or a creature you can see, hits the target of
            your Adroit Analysis with a weapon attack, you can use your
            reaction to turn that attack into an automatic critical hit.
            Once you use this reaction, you must complete a short or
            long rest before you can use it again.
