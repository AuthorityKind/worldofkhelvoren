        Most successful monarchs, conquerors, and revolutions have
        a master strategist that is responsible for their success on the
        battlefield. Known as Tacticians, these intelligent leaders are
        always one step ahead of their enemies and strive to have a
        plan for every eventuality. They know the strategies that lead
        to glorious victory, and those that end in utter ruin. Alone, a
        Tactician is no threat, but with powerful allies to command,
        they become a formidable force, capable of toppling empires.

            When you join this Academic Discipline at 3rd level, you gain
            proficiency and expertise in History. If you are already proficient in History you
            gain proficiency in another skill from the savant skill list.
        </p>
        <p class="feature">
            You also gain proficiency with all medium armor, light and medium shields,
            and all martial weapons without the heavy property. When
            you wear light or medium armor, you can use Intelligence,
            in place of Dexterity, when calculating your Armor Class.

        <p class="feature">
            You can use your knowledge of warfare to direct your allies
            on the battlefield. Staring at 3rd level, you can use an action
            to issue one of the Orders below, targeting a creature within
            60 feet, other than yourself, that can see or hear you. A single
            creature can only benefit from one Order at a time.
            When you issue an Order, you can spend an Intellect Die to
            grant the target temporary hit points equal to your Die roll.
        </p>
        <p class="feature-saveDC">
            <strong>Attack Order.</strong> The next time the target of this Order takes
            the Attack action before the start of your next turn, it can
            make one additional weapon attack as part of that action.
        </p>
        <p class="feature-saveDC">
            <strong>Defensive Order.</strong> Until the beginning of your next turn, the
            target of this Order gains a bonus to its Armor Class equal to
            your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1 Armor Class).
        </p>
        <p class="feature-saveDC">
            <strong>Maneuvering Order.</strong> The target of this Order can use its
            reaction to immediately move up to its full movement speed
            without provoking opportunity attacks.
        </p>
        <p class="feature-saveDC">
            <strong>Steadfast Order.</strong> Until the beginning of your next turn, the
            target of this Order gains a bonus to any Strength, Dexterity,
            or Constitution ability checks and saving throws they make
            equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).

        <p class="feature">
            Your position as a leader doesn't allow you to succumb to
            your base instincts. Starting at 6th level, you have advantage
            on saving throws to resist the effects of enchantment spells,
            and you are immune to the frightened condition.
            In addition, when you use your action to issue an Order,
            you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.

        <h2 class="feature">Strategic Genius</h2>
        <p class="feature">
            Your genius allows you to coordinate multiple allies. Starting
            at 13th level, when you use your action to issue an Order, you
            can issue the same Order to another creature within range.

            Your Orders inspire heroic action in your allies. Beginning at
            17th level, when you spend an Intellect Die to grant the target
            of an Order temporary hit points, you add your Intelligence
            modifier (minimum of 1) to the temporary hit points.
            Also, when you use your action to issue an Order, you can
            target up to three creatures in range with the same Order.
