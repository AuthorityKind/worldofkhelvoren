        The savants known as Culinarians put their great intellects to
        work in the science of food and drink. Ever the adventurers,
        they leave their kitchens behind, venturing out into the world
        in a lifelong search for new wondrous and exotic ingredients.
        What strange and exciting recipes will you come to discover?

        <h2>Student of Flavor</h2>
        <p>
            When you adopt this Academic Discipline at 3rd level, you
            gain proficiency and expertise in Nature and with cook's utensils. If you're already proficient in Nature,
            you gain proficiency in another skill from the savant skill list.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, if you have access to your cook’s utensils and
            ingredients to cook with, any creature that spends at least 1
            Hit Die to regain their hit points during a short rest with you
            regains additional hit points equal to your Intellect Die.
        </p>

    <!--Adventurer's Cook Book-->
    <div class="feature">
        <h2>Adventurer's Cook Book</h2>
        <p>
            At 3rd level, you begin to compile a Cook Book of the Recipes
            you have learned during the course of your adventures.
        </p>
        <p id="subheader"><strong>Adding a Recipe</strong></p>
        <p> As an action, you can harvest a sample
            from a creature that died within the last minute and preserve
            it to create a Recipe. Over the course of 1 hour, which can be
            during a short or long rest, you can use cook's utensils and a
            sample to create a new Recipe based on the creature type of
            the sample from the list at the end of this Discipline.
        </p>
        <p id="subheader"><strong>Preparing a Morsel</strong></p>
        <p> At the end of a short or long rest, you
            can expend any number of Intellect Dice, preparing a Morsel
            for each Intellect Die you expend. Each Morsel you prepare
            has the properties of one of the Recipes you currently have in
            your Cook Book. You do not need to have ingredients from a
            Recipe's creature type to prepare a Morsel from that Recipe.
            Any Morsels you prepare lose their potency at the end of
            your next short or long rest and become inedible.
        </p>
        <p id="subheader"><strong>Saving Morsels</strong></p>
        <p> As an action, a creature can eat a
            Morsel you have prepared, or feed it to a conscious willing
            creature within its reach. A creature that eats a Morsel gains
            the benefits of the Morsel as detailed in its Recipe. A creature
            can only benefit from one Morsel at a time. Eating a Morsel
            instantly ends any previous Morsel benefits a creature has.
        </p>
        <p id="subheader"><strong>Replacing Your Cook Book</strong></p>
        <p> Should your Cook Book be
            lost or destroyed, you must reacquire fresh samples of each
            creature type in order to recreate any Recipes you knew.
            You can create a copy of your Cook Book by spending an
            hour copying each Recipe contained within the Cook Book.
        </p>

    <div class="feature">
        <h2>A Cut Above</h2>
        <p>
            Beginning at 6th level, you can expend an Intellect Die as an
            action to create a Morsel from your Cook Book. Morsels you
            prepare this way have their duration reduced to 10 minutes.
            In addition, when you use your action to eat a Morsel, feed
            a Morsel to another creature, harvest a sample, or prepare a
            Morsel, you can make a weapon attack as a bonus action
        </p>
    </div>

    <!--Improved Recipes-->
    <div class="feature">
        <h2>Improved Recipes</h2>
        <p>
            Your Recipes invigorate your allies along with their normal
            benefits. Starting at 13th level, creatures that eat one of your
            Morsels gain temporary hit points equal to your savant level.

    <!--Master Culinarian-->
    <div class="feature">
        <h2>Master Culinarian</h2>
        <p>
            You are a master monster chef and can cook with anything,
            anywhere. Starting at 17th level, during the course of a long
            rest, you can use your cook's utensils to prepare a monstrous
            feast for a number of creatures equal to your savant level.
            Any creature that eats a portion of this meal gains the
            benefits listed below until the end of their next long rest:

            &bull; Their hit point maximum increases by an amount equal

            from various creature samples. Some of the Recipes have a

            Part of the genius of a Culinarian is the creation of
