    <p class="fluff">Specializing in the study of forgotten civilizations, ancient
        places, and uncharted lands, Archaeologists bring the light of
        knowledge to the dark and deadly places of the world. Doing
        their best to uncover the wisdom of ages long forgotten, they
        tend to feel a sad kinship with the civilizations they study and
        go to great lengths not to destroy or offend their memory. For
        an Archaeologist, the best way to improve the present is to
        learn from both the mistakes and innovations of the past.

            holding, you can ascertain its value, its civilization of origin,
            and its approximate age. If it has any magical properties, you
            learn of them as if you had cast identify targeting the object.

        <p>
            The places you explore have honed your survival instincts
            and given you special insight into the workings of ancient
            magic items. At 3rd level, you gain the following benefits:
        </p>
        <p id="indent">&bull; You gain proficiency with whips and improvised weapons.</p>
        <p id="indent">&bull; You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.</p>
        <p id="indent">&bull; When you make an ability check or saving throw that uses
            your Dexterity, you can add an Intellect Die to your roll.</p>
        <p id="indent">&bull; You can expend a use of Expert Student to ignore a class,
            race, or alignment restriction to attune to a magic item.</p>
        <p id="indent">&bull; You can use a bonus action on your turn to use a magic
            item that normally takes an action to use.</p>

    <!--Daring Determination-->
    <div class="feature">
        <h2>Daring Determination</h2>
        <p>
            You are well acquainted with dangerous situations. Starting
            at 6th level, the target of your Adroit Analysis cannot target
            you with opportunity attacks. Also, when a creature targets
            you with an opportunity attack, you can use your reaction to
            impose disadvantage on its attack roll.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, when you are forced to make a saving throw to
            resist the effects of a trap, you gain a bonus to your roll equal
            to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1). If a trap allows
            you to take only half damage on a success, you instead take
            no damage if you succeed, and only half damage if you fail.
        </p>

    <!--Lore Master-->
    <div class="feature">
        <h2>Lore Master</h2>
        <p>
            You study every myth, legend, and folk tale you find, knowing
            that each story is based on a grain of truth. Starting at 13th
            level, if you observe a person, place, or object for at least 1
            hour, you can mystically recall information about the target as
            if you had cast legend lore on it. The target does not need to
            be of legendary importance for you to gain information
        </p>
        <p>
            Starting at 17th level, you only need to observe a person,
            place, or object for 1 minute in order to use this feature.

    <!--Master Archeologist-->
    <div class="feature">
        <h2>Master Archeologist</h2>
        <p>
            Your exposure to the magical effects has caused you
