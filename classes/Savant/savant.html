    <div class="feature">
        <h2 class="feature">Adroit Analysis</h2>
        <p class="feature">Starting at 1st level, you can quickly analyze a foe's strengths and weaknesses. As a bonus
            action, you can Mark a creature you can see within 60 feet, gaining the following benefits for 1 minute or
            until you Mark another creatur</p>
        <p class="feature-saveDC">&#9679; You can use Intelligence, in place of Strength or Dexterity,
            for your attack and damage rolls against that creature</p>
        <p class="feature-saveDC">&#9679; If you hit the creature with an attack, or observe it for 1
            minute, you learn one of the following characteristics of
            your choice: Armor Class, speed, one ability score, one of
            its senses, its maximum hit points, or its creature type.</p>
        <p class="feature-saveDC">&#9679; You have advantage on any Intelligence or Wisdom-based
            ability checks you make to analyze the creature</p>
    </div>

    <!--Quick Wit-->
    <div class="feature">
        <h2 class="feature">Quick Wit</h2>
        <p class="feature">
            You can use your keen intellect to analyze your surroundings
            at a moment's notice, even in the midst of battle. Starting at
            1st level, you can use a bonus action on your turn to take the
            Search action, or to make an ability check using any
            Intelligence or Wisdom-based skill proficiency you have.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!--Unarmored Defense-->
    <div class="feature">
        <h2 class="feature">Unarmored Defense</h2>
        <p class="feature">
            Your observant style of fighting allows you to anticipate and
            dodge attacks. Starting at 1st level, when you are not wearing
            any armor or wielding a shield, your Armor Class is equal to
            10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Intelligence modifier
        </p>
    </div>

    <!--Expert Student-->
    <div class="feature">
        <h2 class="feature">Expert Student</h2>
        <p class="feature">
            Your ability to learn and retain new abilities and languages is
            beyond compare. Beginning at 2nd level, each time you finish
            a long rest, you can choose to learn one additional language,
            or gain proficiency in one tool, skill, or weapon of your choice,
            as long as there is an example for you to learn from (such as
            a willing teacher with that proficiency, a manual, or a book in
            a different language). You can only gain one proficiency or
            language from this feature per long rest.
        </p>
        <p class="feature">
            You can learn a total number of additional languages and
            proficiencies through this feature equal to your Intelligence
            modifier (minimum of 1). Should you choose to learn another
            language or proficiency while you are at your maximum, you
            must choose a language or proficiency you learned through
            this feature to forget, as you can only remember so many
            hastily learned skills at once. Upon replacing a language or
            proficiency you immediately lose any skill or knowledge of it
        </p>
        <p class="feature">
            When you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn a new
            language or proficiency at the end of each short or long rest.

    <!--Intellect Dice-->
    <div class="feature">
        <h2 class="feature">Intellect Dice</h2>
        <p class="feature">
            At 2nd level, you gain a pool of Intellect Dice which represent
            your mental stamina. Whenever you make an ability check or
            saving throw that uses Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma,
            you can expend one of these Dice and add it to your roll. You
            can do so after you roll, but before you know if you succeed
            or fail. You have a total number of Intellect Dice equal to your
            Intelligence modifier + your Wisdom modifier, and you regain
            all expended Dice when you finish a short or long rest.
        </p>
        <p class="feature">
            Your Intellect Dice begin as d4s, and increase in size as
            you gain levels in this class, as indicated in the Savant table
        </p>

            Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever

            to three when you reach 11th level in this class and to four when you
            reach 20th level in this class. If you already have the Extra Attack
            feature from another class, you can gain both one Fighting Style from
            the Fighter and learn an additional Maneuver. If you reach 11th or 20th
            level in this class with Extra Attack from another class, you still gain

            At 9th level, you can persist through most dangers. When you make a
            saving throw, you expend a superiority die and add it to the saving
            throw. You can do this after you have made the saving throw, but before
            you know the outcome of the roll. Additionally, choose a Saving throw
            you are not Proficient with. You gain proficiency with that Saving
            Throw.

            Beginning at 13th level, the spark of a fight can light the fire of war
            within you, even when the flames have dwindled. When you roll
            initiative, and you have any number of expended Superiority Dice, you
            can choose to regain a number of expended Superiority Dice equal to half
            of your total number of Superiority Die but it cannot exceed your total
            number of Superiority Dice. You can use this once and need to take a
            Long rest to be able to do so again.

            At 17th level, you can suffer through nearly everything thrown at you.
            When you make a Saving Throw you are proficient with, and you use your
            Indomitable feature on that Saving Throw, then, if the Saving Throw is
            used to determine if you take full or half damage, you then also take
            only half the damage on a failed save and no damage on a successful
            save. If the effect that you made a Saving Throw against had any other
            effect that occurred when you succeed the Saving Throw, you can choose
            to forego it.

            Beginning at 20th level, you have become the apex combatant. If you roll
            a number lower than either your Strength or Dexterity modifier (you
            choose) on your Superiority Dice, you do not expend a usage of your
            Superiority Die and the dice is instead equal to your Strength or
            Dexterity modifier (you choose). Additionally, once per turn, when you
            use a Maneuver, you can choose to not have to expend a Superiority Die,
            and instead have either your Strength or Dexterity Modifier be the
            result of what would have been your rolled Superiority Die.
