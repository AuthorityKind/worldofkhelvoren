            for your attack and damage rolls against that creature</p>
        <p class="feature-saveDC">&#9679; If you hit the creature with an attack, or observe it for 1
            minute, you learn one of the following characteristics of
            your choice: Armor Class, speed, one ability score, one of
            its senses, its maximum hit points, or its creature type.</p>
        <p class="feature-saveDC">&#9679; You have advantage on any Intelligence or Wisdom-based
            ability checks you make to analyze the creature</p>

    <!--Quick Wit-->
    <div class="feature">
        <h2 class="feature">Quick Wit</h2>
        <p class="feature">
            You can use your keen intellect to analyze your surroundings
            at a moment's notice, even in the midst of battle. Starting at
            1st level, you can use a bonus action on your turn to take the
            Search action, or to make an ability check using any
            Intelligence or Wisdom-based skill proficiency you have.
        </p>

        <p class="feature">
            Your observant style of fighting allows you to anticipate and
            dodge attacks. Starting at 1st level, when you are not wearing
            any armor or wielding a shield, your Armor Class is equal to
            10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Intelligence modifier

        <h2 class="feature">Expert Student</h2>
        <p class="feature">
            Your ability to learn and retain new abilities and languages is
            beyond compare. Beginning at 2nd level, each time you finish
            a long rest, you can choose to learn one additional language,
            or gain proficiency in one tool, skill, or weapon of your choice,
            as long as there is an example for you to learn from (such as
            a willing teacher with that proficiency, a manual, or a book in
            a different language). You can only gain one proficiency or
            language from this feature per long rest.
        </p>
        <p class="feature">
            You can learn a total number of additional languages and
            proficiencies through this feature equal to your Intelligence
            modifier (minimum of 1). Should you choose to learn another
            language or proficiency while you are at your maximum, you
            must choose a language or proficiency you learned through
            this feature to forget, as you can only remember so many
            hastily learned skills at once. Upon replacing a language or
            proficiency you immediately lose any skill or knowledge of it
        </p>
        <p class="feature">
            When you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn a new
            language or proficiency at the end of each short or long rest.

    <!--Intellect Dice-->
    <div class="feature">
        <h2 class="feature">Intellect Dice</h2>
        <p class="feature">
            At 2nd level, you gain a pool of Intellect Dice which represent
            your mental stamina. Whenever you make an ability check or
            saving throw that uses Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma,
            you can expend one of these Dice and add it to your roll. You
            can do so after you roll, but before you know if you succeed
            or fail. You have a total number of Intellect Dice equal to your
            Intelligence modifier + your Wisdom modifier, and you regain
            all expended Dice when you finish a short or long rest.
        </p>
        <p class="feature">
            Your Intellect Dice begin as d4s, and increase in size as
            you gain levels in this class, as indicated in the Savant table

            When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and
            19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice
            by 2, or two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
            can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature
            Alternatively, you can take a feat you meet the prerequisites for.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!--Accelerated Reflexes-->
    <div class="feature">
        <h2 class="feature">Accelerated Reflexes</h2>
        <p class="feature">
            The speed at which you can react to stimuli is incredible. At
            5th level, you gain one additional reaction you can take each
            round. A single effect can only trigger one of your reactions.
            Moreover, when you roll initiative, you can take the Ready
            action before anyone acts, so long as you are not surprised.
            Upon reaching 17th level, your reflexes increase again,
            allowing you another reaction per round (for a total of 3).

        <p class="feature">
            Also at 5th level, you can highlight your foe's weak points for
            yourself and your allies. When you, or a creature you can see,
            hits the target of your Adroit Analysis with an attack, you can
            use your reaction to increase their attack's damage by 1d8.
            The extra damage increase as you progress in this class, as seen on the Savant Table.
        </p>
    </div>

        <h2 class="feature">Keen Awareness</h2>

            You can react to danger at a moment's notice. Starting at 7th
            level, you cannot be surprised unless you are incapacitated.
            In addition, when you roll initiative, you can use Adroit
            Analysis to Mark a creature you can see within 60 feet.

        <h2 class="feature">Expert Educator</h2>
        <p class="feature">
            Your ability to educate others is peerless. Starting at 9th level,
            as part of a long rest, you choose a number of creatures equal
            to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1), and one tool,
            skill, or weapon proficiency, or one language you know. The
            creatures gain that proficiency or learn to understand and
            speak that language until the end of your next long rest.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!--Flawless Observation-->
    <div class="feature">
        <h2 class="feature">Flawless Observation</h2>
        <p class="feature">
            Starting at 11th level, you can use Potent Observation when
            a creature hits another creature you can see with a weapon
            attack, even if the target is not marked by Adroit Analysis.
            Also, if you use Potent Observation to increase the damage
            against the creature marked by your Adroit Analysis you add
            your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1) to the damage.

            Starting at 14th level, when you fail a saving throw to resist
            being charmed, frightened, or stunned, you can expend an
            Intellect Die to automatically succeed instead.
            Additionally, when you roll initiative with no Intellect Dice
            remaining, you instantly regain one expended Intellect Die
