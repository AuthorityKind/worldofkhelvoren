        <p class="propperty" id="aspects"><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 hour</p>
        <p class="propperty" id="aspects"><b>Range:</b> Touch</p>
        <p class="propperty" id="aspects"><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (25 gp worth of powdered silver, which the spell
            consumes)</p>
        <p class="propperty" id="aspects"><b>Duration:</b> Special (see below)</p>
        <p class="propperty" id="solos">You perform one of several religious ceremonies. When you cast the spell, choose
            one of the following ceremonies, the target of which must be within 10 feet of you throughout the casting.
        </p>
        <p class="propperty" id="solos"><b>Atonement.</b> You touch one willing creature whose alignment has changed,
            and you make a DC 20 Insight check. On a successful check, you restore the target to its original
            alignment.</p>
        <p class="propperty" id="solos"><b>Bless Water.</b> You touch one vial of water and cause it to become holy
            water.</p>
        <p class="propperty" id="solos"><b>Coming of Age.</b> You touch one humanoid who is a young adult. For the next
            24 hours, whenever the target makes an ability check, it can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the
            ability check. A creature can benefit from this rite only once.</p>
        <p class="propperty" id="solos"><b>Dedication.</b> You touch one humanoid who wishes to be dedicated to your
            god’s service. For the next 24 hours, whenever the target makes a saving throw, it can roll a d4 and add the
            number rolled to the save. A creature can benefit from this rite only once.</p>
        <p class="propperty" id="solos"><b>Funereal Rite.</b> You touch one corpse, and for the next 7 days, the target
            can’t become undead by any means short of a Wish spell.</p>
        <p class="propperty" id="solos"><b>Investiture.</b> You touch one willing humanoid. Choose one 1st-level spell
            you have prepared and expend a spell slot and any material components as if you were casting that spell. The
            spell has no effect. Instead, the target can cast this spell once without having to expend a spell slot or
            use material components. If the target doesn’t cast the spell within 1 hour, the invested spell is lost.</p>
        <p class="propperty" id="solos"><b>Wedding.</b> You touch adult humanoids willing to be bonded together in
            marriage. For the next 7 days, each target gains a +2 bonus to AC while they are within 30 feet of each
            other. A creature can benefit from this rite again only if widowed.</p>
