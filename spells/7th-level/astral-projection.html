        <h2 class="propperty">Astral Projection</h2>
        <p class="propperty" id="leavehimalone"><b>7th-Level Necromancy Spell</b></p>
        <p class="propperty" id="aspects"><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 Hour</p>
        <p class="propperty" id="aspects"><b>Range:</b> 10ft</p>
        <p class="propperty" id="aspects"><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (for each creature you affect with this spell, you
            must provide one jacinth worth at least 1,000 gp and one ornately carved bar of silver worth at least 100
            gp, all of which the spell consumes)</p>
        <p class="propperty" id="aspects"><b>Duration:</b> Special</p>
        <p class="propperty" id="solos">You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral bodies
            into the Astral Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you are already on that plane). The
            material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it doesn't need food or
            air and doesn't age.</p>
        <p class="propperty" id="solos">Your astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating
            your game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that
            extends from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This
            cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home.
            If the cord is cut - something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does - your
            soul and body are separated, killing you instantly</p>
        <p class="propperty" id="solos">Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through
            portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when
            casting this spell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to
            re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or
            other effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to
            it. The spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends,
            the affected creature returns to its physical body, and it awakens.
        </p>
        <p class="propperty" id="solos">The spell might also end early for you or one of your companions. A successful
            Dispel Magic spell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature. If a creature’s
            original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If the spell ends
            and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the creature’s astral form back to its body, ending its state
            of suspended animation. If you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral
            forms and must find their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit points.
